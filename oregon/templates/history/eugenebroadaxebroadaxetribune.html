<p><em>Broad-Axe</em><br />
  [LCCN: sn96088146]<br />
  Eugene, Lane County, Oregon<br />
  189?-1900</p>
<p>James Fance Amis created the <em>Broad-Axe Tribune</em> [LCCN: sn96088145] in  March of 1894, two years after the Oregon People&rsquo;s Party was founded, solely to  champion the Populist Party, or People&rsquo;s Party, which emerged as a political reaction  to the financial and social struggles felt by the American working class in the  years after the Civil War.  Gaining  support in the late 19th century, the movement spread to Oregon in  the 1890s but failed to achieve any significant influence.  Nonetheless, the Populist Party was still an  attractive ideology, especially to farmers of the Willamette Valley who &ldquo;had  long suffered at the hands of transportation monopolies and credit markets,&rdquo;  and Populism certainly had its bulldogs in Oregon.  Once the populist movement faded and merged  with other political ideologies, so too did the <em>Broad-Axe </em>dissolve.</p>
<p>Amis was born in Kentucky around  1827 and fought in the Mexican-American War in the 1840s.  He eventually moved to Oregon, settling in  southern Eugene.  He was the city&rsquo;s first  Justice of the Peace and served as a Representative of Lane County in the state  government from 1870-72.  At this point  he began to frequently correspond with Joseph Lane, the first territorial  governor of Oregon and fellow veteran.   He was a politically active man whose own leanings began to align with  the burgeoning Populist Party in the late 1800s.</p>
<p>Frustrated with the political  complexion of the state and, especially, with the abuse being laid upon the  Populist Party, Amis&rsquo; publication was meant to defend Populist ideas and act as  platform to promote the party&rsquo;s principles.   This was no easy feat, as the <em>Eugene  City Guard </em>[LCCN: sn84022653]<em>, </em>the  Eugene <em>Oregon State Journal </em>[LCCN:  sn83045535], the Eugene <em>Register </em>[LCCN:  sn96088117], the Cottage Grove <em>Bohemia  Nugget </em>[LCCN: sn96088074]and  several other newspapers ridiculed the very idea of starting a Populist paper  and claimed the <em>Broad-Axe</em> &ldquo;had but a  hat full of type, was an anarchist sheet and should not be sustained.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The paper began as a four-page  weekly, costing subscribers $1.50 a year.   Sometime between November of 1894 and the following June, Amis dropped  &ldquo;Tribune&rdquo; from the title and the paper was published simply as the <em>Broad-Axe</em> [LCCN: sn96088146].  Along with the new name, the <em>Broad-Axe </em>reduced its price to $1.00 a  year and Amis&rsquo; son joined as a publisher.  The paper reported heavily on national and  local government and printed information on Populist Party meetings, elections  and events.  Issues of importance to the political  movement, like the gold standard and labor laws, were also heavily  covered.  Short news items of general  interest would appear on the last page and little, if any, attention was given  to agricultural and societal news.</p>
<p>True to his word, Amis used the  publication to not only promote and defend Populist ideas but to also attack the  predominately Republican political leanings of the state government.  The name &ldquo;Broad-Axe&rdquo; was specifically chosen  to reflect the combative attitude the paper had to assume due to the  journalistic hostility the publication faced.   With regard to the title, Amis stated in 1900 after the paper&rsquo;s  dissolution, &ldquo;Fight?  Yes we had to  fight!  And what better weapon than the  Broad-Axe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amis was a staunch, diligent,  and forceful defender of the political movement, and this attitude would allow  him both advocates and enemies in the realm of journalism.  In 1895, the Salem <em>Capital Journal </em>[LCCN: sn99063954] stated that &ldquo;Colonel Amis, of  the Eugene <em>Broad­-Axe</em>, has taken a  snorter of his favorite brand of Kentucky Bourbon, set his liberty cap at an  angle of 45 degrees, and unsheathed his people&rsquo;s party poniard on the state  university.&rdquo;  The <em>Bohemia Nugget </em>called the <em>Broad-Axe </em>a &ldquo;journalistic monstrosity&rdquo; and described &ldquo;Jimmy&rdquo; himself as &ldquo;an old  huckster who is dying of a broken heart because of non-patronage.&rdquo;  </p>
<p>The paper struggled to stay  afloat during its six year span, and in 1896 the <em>Broad-Axe</em> briefly suspended publication due to the &ldquo;stringency of  and scarcity of money and general stagnation of business.&rdquo;  The paper continued to flounder despite  absorbing the Eugene <em>Weekly Record </em>[LCCN:  sn97058448] in January of 1899.  On  November 24, 1899, the Toledo <em>Lincoln  County Leader</em> [LCCN: sn85033162] resolutely declared that the &ldquo;<em>Broad-Axe</em> has been ground down until it  isn&rsquo;t much bigger than a hatchet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On March 7, 1900, Amis  discontinued the <em>Broad-Axe</em> and  instead began printing the <em>Weekly Citizen </em>[LCCN: 2013260000].   In the first  issue of the <em>Citizen </em>Amis writes,  &ldquo;The populist people are now treated with respect and their paper is allowed to  go along like other papers without a constant display of arms with which to  defend itself.  Its editor, too, is less  belligerently inclined.  He no longer  sees the necessity of fighting and feels more like being a nice old man of  peace, a good and quiet &lsquo;Citizen&rsquo; than one bearing about on his shoulder a  Broad-Axe all the day long… Again as you know we have reduced the dimensions of  the Axe to such an extent that many have called it &lsquo;The Hatchet&rsquo; which we feel  is probably proper and just.  Hence in a  few words we have &ldquo;buried the hatchet&rdquo; and from out its tomb has come &lsquo;The  Citizen.&rsquo;  And how do you like it?&rdquo;</p>
