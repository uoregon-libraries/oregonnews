<p><em>La  Grande Observer</em><br />
  [LCCN:  2006260039]<br />
  La  Grande, Union County, Oregon <br />
  1896  â€“ 1968</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The town of La Grande was founded in northeastern Oregon in  1861 by Oregon Trail immigrants and was designated as the county seat of Union  County, nestled between the Wallowa Mountains and the Blue Mountains in the  Grande Ronde River valley. Nearby gold mines and rich valley agriculture drew  more settlers to La Grande in the 1870s. A railroad was constructed through the  area in 1884, bolstering the economy and leading to further expansion of the  town.</p>
<p>George Hoskins Currey, previous editor of the <em>Grant&rsquo;s Pass Courier</em> [LCCN: sn96088280] founded  La Grande&rsquo;s <em>Eastern Oregon Observer</em> [LCCN: 2006260032] in 1896 as a weekly paper in support of the Populist Party.  Currey used a printing plant that was moved to La Grande from Baker City, and the <em>Observer</em> started with eight-column  pages at 20x25 inches in size. </p>
<p>Fred B. Currey joined the business in 1897, and the brothers  launched the <em>Daily Morning Observer </em>[LCCN:  2006260037] in addition to the weekly <em>Observer</em>,  in support of the political campaign that year. When the Populist Party fused  with the Democratic Party in 1898, the <em>Observer</em> claimed to be politically Independent, but soon revealed Republican leanings. The  temporary daily publication was so popular that the <em>La Grande Morning Observer</em> [LCCN: 2006260038] was formally established  on November 1, 1901, and in 1903, daily publication changed from mornings to  evenings with a title change to the <em>La  Grande Evening Observer</em> [LCCN: 2006260039]. </p>
<p>The daily paper featured striking, bold headlines such as  &ldquo;Use Bombs to Kill Capitalists of Wall Street&rdquo; (1908), and did not shy away  from rhetoric of race and ethnicity, featuring headlines such as &ldquo;Japs Assume  the Aggressive&rdquo; (1908), &ldquo;Indian Lands Leased: Long winded affair requiring much  red tape&rdquo; (1904), &ldquo;Congress May Oust Negroes from United States Army: worthy in  battle but a menace in peace&rdquo; (1906), and &ldquo;Wealthy Mexican Arrested&rdquo; (1906). </p>
<p>Crime, railroad and fire accidents, international relations,  politics, and legal decisions often took the front page, while local social  updates, news from other states, classified ads, and church service listings  were surrounded by local advertisements within the paper. Early issues  emphasized the importance of advances in industry, new homes and buildings, and  a 1905 article asserted that active communities attract active people and  growth: &ldquo;That La Grande has grown to be one of the leading cities in the state  is patent, and the same conditions that have caused its development in the past  will cause future growth.&rdquo; By 1916 the <em>Evening  Observer</em> included a dedicated Editorial Page, loaded with how-to articles  for the home and garden, farming advice, fashion news, and political cartoons.</p>
<p>The weekly publication was also still in full swing, with  layout and content similar to the daily, and its name was changed from the <em>Eastern Oregon Observer</em> to the <em>La Grande Weekly Observer </em>[LCCN: 2006260033]  in 1905, costing $1.00 for a year&rsquo;s subscription. Unlike many historic  newspapers in Oregon, the <em>Observer</em> provided sports coverage in nearly every issue, and the La Grande football team  was pictured in the December 22, 1905 issue of the <em>Weekly Observer</em>. </p>
<p>Fred Currey left the  paper in 1907, leaving George in full control once again, and a machine  composition No. 5 Mergenthaler was also brought in to the plant that year. In 1910,  Bruce Dennis, editor of the <em>Baker City Herald</em> [LCCN: sn96088192], came to La Grande and bought the <em>Observer</em>. One year later, the <em>Observer</em> purchased the <em>La Grande</em> <em>Morning Star</em> [LCCN: 2006260042], which was  founded in 1907 by Molly K. Proebstel. In 1914, Dennis sold the <em>Observer</em> to Clark Leiter, previous  editor of the <em>Portland</em> <em>Morning Oregonian </em>[LCCN: sn83025138], in  partnership with Mrs. Leiter and Don Meyers. Leiter installed the first web  press in La Grande and added a metropolitan element to the paper. In 1918,  Dennis resumed ownership of the <em>Observer</em> titles, and Leiter went on to edit the <em>Portland  Telegram</em> [LCCN: sn86063804], later serving as a professor of journalism at  the University of Illinois.</p>
<p>The <em>La Grande Weekly  Observer</em> added the <em>La Grande Star</em> to the title [LCCN: 2006260035], changing the weekly&rsquo;s name to <em>The Observer-Star</em> [LCCN: 2006260036] in  1921. In 1925, the <em>Observer</em> was sold to  Frank B. Appleby and Harve Mathews, while Dennis left La Grande and purchased Klamath  Falls&rsquo; <em>The Evening Herald</em> [LCCN:  sn99063812].</p>
<p>P.R. Finlay bought the Observer in 1930, and his son, Harold M. Finlay, took over from 1932  to 1938 following his father&rsquo;s death. In 1959, the daily publication changed  names from the <em>La Grande Evening Observer</em> to the <em>La Grande Observer</em> [LCCN: 2006260040],  published every day except Sunday. In 1968 the name was shortened to simply <em>The Observer</em> [LCCN: 2006260041], which is  still in publication today.</p>
