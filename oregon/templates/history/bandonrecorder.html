<p><em>Bandon  recorder</em><br />
[LCCN:  sn93051610]<br />
Bandon,  Coos County, Oregon<br />
188?-1910</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 1851, french fur trappers discovered gold at Whiskey Run  Beach on the coast of southern Oregon, sparking settlers’ interest in the  coastal town now known as Bandon. With the arrival of Anglo settlers, farming,  cheese-making, logging, and shipping at the mouth of the Coquille River quickly  became key economic functions in the area. Named after settlers arrived from  Bandon, Ireland, the City of Bandon was officially incorporated on February 18,  1891, and became a popular tourist attraction on the Oregon coast by 1910. By  1912, Bandon had become a prime shipping port between San Francisco and  Portland.</p>
<p>Bandon’s  first newspaper, the <em>Bandon Recorder</em> [LCCN: sn93051610], actually had roots in Denmark, Oregon, where P.O. Chilstrom  and J.M.  Upton (son of early Oregon newspaperman J.H. Upton), founded the <em>Curry  County Recorder </em>[LCCN: unknown] in 1883<em>. </em>The paper was published weekly on  Thursdays until the title was changed to the <em>Southwest Oregon Recorder </em>[LCCN:sn96088349] in 1884, published on Tuesdays. In 1885, publication switched  to Saturdays.</p>
<p>It was not until 1887 that Chilstrom and Upton moved their  publication to Bandon, and shortly after, the paper became known as the <em>Bandon Recorder. </em>In the late 1880s,  David E. Stitt took over for Chilstrom until 1906, succeeded by publisher George  P. Laird and editor S.W. Scottin. Editors  of the <em>Recorder</em> in the early 1900s  included Irving S. Bath in 1907, Graydon T. Treadgold in 1908, and C.E. Kopf from 1909 to 1916. From 1910  to 1915 the paper ran twice a week as the <em>Semi-weekly  Bandon Recorder </em>[LCCN: sn96088347], then changed back to a weekly, again  titled <em>The Bandon Recorder</em> [LCCN:  sn96088348].</p>
<p>In addition to state, national, and international news  stories, the <em>Recorder</em> included  updates on local events such as live music performances and social dances, news  of local businesses and real estate prospects, and information on church  sermons and services, as well as columns on agricultural news and practices. Women&rsquo;s  issues were discussed in articles &ldquo;By Women, For Women&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Woman&rsquo;s World&rdquo;  column, and announcements for activities such as &ldquo;lady bowling&rdquo; and ladies&rsquo;  club gatherings appeared frequently. </p>
<p>Poems, editorials, and short stories with illustrations  appeared in the paper as well. On the front page of an 1890 issue, the <em>Recorder</em> featured a poem titled &ldquo;The  Rigs and Jigs of Bandon,&rdquo; harkening back to the town&rsquo;s Irish influences: &ldquo;Oh!  My name&rsquo;s Pat McQuillan, I live close to Bandon, the rising young sea port on  the brink of the sea; and as long as I&rsquo;ve got just a leg to stand on, I&rsquo;ll  stick to fair Bandon, she&rsquo;s darling for me.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Facing competition from the up and coming <em>Bandon</em> <em>Western World</em> [LCCN: sn96088350], established in 1912, the <em>Recorder</em> went bankrupt in the spring of  1915, at which point Richard B. Swenson, of Riverside, California, took over  management with the help of Harry Crain, who later worked for the <em>Salem Capital Journal</em> [LCCN: sn90066132].  However, the <em>Western World</em> prevailed  and the <em>Recorder</em> was suspended in the  summer of 1916, at which time Swenson left Bandon to purchase the <em>Monmouth Herald</em> [LCCN: sn96088093]. The <em>Western World</em> is still in publication  today.</p>
