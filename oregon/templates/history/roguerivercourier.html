 <p>Prominent newspaperman Jacob H. Stine established the <em>Grant&rsquo;s Pass Courier </em>[LCCN: sn96088280] on  April 3, 1885, in Grants Pass, Oregon. Stine&rsquo;s &ldquo;Independent Paper Devoted to  the Interests of Josephine County and Southern Oregon&rdquo; started as a seven-column,  four-page weekly priced at $2.50 for a year&rsquo;s subscription. </p>
 <p>
   Management of the <em>Courier </em>changed hands six times between 1885 and 1890. In 1886, Stine sold out to  William J. Wimer, who changed the name of the paper to the <em>Rogue River Courier</em>. In 1887, Wimer turned the <em>Courier</em> over to Alfred  A. Allworth, who then sold the paper to Editor Frank T. Sheppard in 1888.  The operation was quickly handed over to Editor George H. Currey before Jerry  Nunan took over in 1890, running the <em>Courier</em> for seven years before selling his interests to Calvin &ldquo;Champ&rdquo; Price and Amos  E. Voorhies. A veteran of the newspaper industry, Voorhies had worked for the  weekly <em>Greenville</em> <em>Independent </em>[LCCN: sn85033630] in his  Michigan hometown before moving to Grants Pass, where he earned the nickname  &ldquo;Boss&rdquo; while working for the <em>Oregon  Observer</em> [LCCN: sn96088282].  In 1899,  Voorhies assumed full ownership of the <em>Courier</em> when Price sold his interests in the paper, thinking that the enterprise was  not large enough to support both men&rsquo;s families. </p>
 <p>Early issues of the <em>Courier </em>offered a blend of national and local news, folk tales, excerpts from  classic novels, and musings on medical advice. The <em>Courier </em>lauded the benefits of a railroad service in Josephine  County, encouraged local and regional economic investment with reports of nearby  discoveries of gold and copper ore, and generally praised the region&rsquo;s  industrial and agricultural potential. The <em>Courier </em>also covered local environmental issues related to Crater Lake, the Oregon  Caves, and declining fish populations in the Rogue River. The paper maintained  its pledge to remain &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; on partisan issues until about 1906, when  the <em>Courier</em> began to favor Republican  candidates in state and national elections.</p>
 <p>The <em>Courier </em>capitalized  on sensational news stories, giving extensive coverage to the Spanish American  War and reporting on a dramatic wreck in Josephine County on the Southern  Pacific Railroad in 1906. The <em>Courier</em> opposed Chinese immigration in the 1880s and 1890s. An article in 1886 supported  Chinese expulsion from Crescent City, California, and in 1892, its editor  judged it &ldquo;odd&rdquo; that Congress avoided violating the immigration treaty with  China. In general, the paper&rsquo;s already limited coverage of issues related to  ethnicity or race was reduced even more during Voorhies&rsquo; management. </p>
 <p>
   Voorhies conducted the <em>Courier</em> as sole publisher from 1899 to 1947, employing at least sixteen different  editors and utilizing state-of-the-art newspaper equipment. The original  Washington hand-press used by Jacob Stine was replaced with a Goss Comet press to  increase production. Around 1910, Voorhies expanded the <em>Rogue River Courier </em>into a daily publication which continued through  1918. In 1919, the daily&rsquo;s name was changed to the <em>Grants Pass Daily Courier</em> [LCCN: sn96088181]. The weekly edition of  the <em>Courier</em> merged with the <em>Observer</em> in 1928, and the daily  publication is still in print today.</p>
