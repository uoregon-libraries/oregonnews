<p><em>Clackamas County Record</em><br />
[LCCN: sn00063710]<br />
Oregon City, Clackamas County,  Oregon<br />
1903-1903</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Starting a newspaper in the  early 20th century was always a risky endeavor subject to fierce  competition.  As the <em>Oregon City Courier</em> [LCCN: sn00063698] wrote on January 9, 1903,  &ldquo;The history of newspapers is that only one in ten that are published live to  become a success and a money maker.&rdquo;  Despite  the experience and effort of its proprietors, the <em>Clackamas County Record </em>[LCCN: sn00063710], published in Oregon  City, would not &ldquo;live long and prosper.&rdquo; The paper would suspend at a  substantial loss for its owners after a short six months.  </p>
<p>The <em>Clackamas County Record</em> was &ldquo;launched into this troubling world&rdquo; by  Edward E. Brodie, David Davis, and A. E. Davis of the Record Publishing Company  on January 5, 1903.  The six-page,  Republican sheet was published twice a week and cost readers $1.75 a year.  According to its proprietors, the <em>Record </em>was created &ldquo;with the sole aim  and purpose of aiding in the great work of promoting the best interests of this  magnificent county, and [to supply] the people of the county with a paper that  will fearlessly give the news.&rdquo;  They went  on to express &ldquo;hope that the product of the venture will be some material  assistance in the development of the best county in Oregon.&rdquo;  However, Brodie&rsquo;s and Davis&rsquo; intentions were  not entirely altruistic.  In the same editorial  which appeared in the debut issue, they stated that the <em>Record</em> &ldquo;comes wholly and entirely as a business venture, its mission  being…to gain a livelihood for its proprietors.&rdquo;  This, unfortunately, would not be the case. </p>
<p>The <em>Clackamas County Record</em> was a &ldquo;clean, well gotten up and up-to-date  country newspaper&rdquo; that mostly focused on dealings within the county and  state.  Several regular columns appeared:  &ldquo;Boys and Girls – Little Stories and  Incidents that Will Interest and Entertain Young Readers&rdquo; provided cute,  anecdotal stories and simple science experiments for children; &ldquo;Woman&rsquo;s Realm,&rdquo;  &ldquo;Women&rsquo;s Doings&rdquo; or some iteration thereof provided rather glib articles on  fashion, beauty and societal news; and an agricultural column also appeared  regularly.</p>
<p>At the start of publication, the <em>Record</em> printed around 1,000  copies.  However, this large circulation  was very short-lived.  According to an <em>Oregon City Courier </em>article from August  7, 1903, shortly after launching the paper &ldquo;the pony Campbell press on which  the [<em>Record</em>] was printed was sent  back to the type foundry and the paper was printed on the <em>Courier</em> press, and the thousand copies were cut down to less than  two hundred&rdquo; which was the circulation thereafter.  The <em>Clackamas  County Record</em> never recovered and soon began losing money. </p>
<p>The publication had always  experienced a precarious existence, and on July 6, 1903 a large advertisement  dominated the front page of the <em>Record</em>.  &ldquo;$1.50&rdquo; bolded and underlined, loudly  declared the new price for a year&rsquo;s subscription and in a multitude of fonts begged  the question: &ldquo;Our subscription price has been reduced to the price of the  weeklies… Why do you take a weekly paper when you can get a semi-weekly for the  same price?&rdquo;  The ad would run until July  23, at which point the subscription price was once again lowered, albeit in a  much quieter manner.  A very small announcement  located on the bottom right of the front page now humbly declared that the <em>Clackamas County Record</em> was only $1.00  per year.  Although it was an earnest  attempt to drum up patronage, the paper was suspended the following week, and  its last issue printed on July 30, 1903.</p>
<p>The bitterness of a failed  publication appears to seep into the <em>Record</em>&rsquo;s  final issue.  An entire column on the  front page was devoted to death notices and several articles on &ldquo;the people&rsquo;s  lack of loyalty to home institutions&rdquo; and Oregon&rsquo;s &ldquo;general absence of  enthusiasm&rdquo; appeared throughout the paper.</p>
<p>After the failure of the <em>Clackamas County Record,</em> only two papers  remained in Oregon City: the <em>Oregon City  Enterprise </em>[LCCN: sn00063700] and the <em>Oregon  City Courier</em>.  On August 7, 1903,  only a week after the <em>Record</em> suspended,  the <em>Enterprise </em>self-righteously wrote,  &ldquo;Once again it has been demonstrated to the satisfaction of the erstwhile  proprietor, editor and manager at least, to say nothing of those who had  financial interests therein, that a third paper cannot exist in Oregon  City.  There is barely a field here for  the two regularly establiseed [sic] papers and every attempt to foist a third  publication on the public has proven a costly experiment.&rdquo;  The<em> Courier</em>, too, took a jab at the <em>Record,</em> stating, &ldquo;Oregon City and Clackamas county will now have to do with two papers  until some other fellow comes along with money to throw away.&rdquo;  In September, subscribers to the <em>Clackamas County Record</em> received the <em>Enterprise </em>in place of the suspended  publication<em>.</em></p>
<p>Even though Edward Brodie and  David Davis were young when they started the <em>Clackamas County Record</em>, they were already quite experienced in the  field of journalism; Brodie had set type at the Eugene <em>Register</em> [LCCN: sn96088117] and both worked as editors at the <em>Oregon City Enterprise</em> before starting  on their own.  Despite the failure of the  paper, Edward Brodie and David Davis would go on to have successful careers in  the field:  Brodie ended up working for  the <em>Morning Enterprise </em>[LCCN: sn00063701]  and<em> Oregon City Courier,</em> and David  Davis joined George C. Cornwall on June 15, 1903 to work on the <em>Timberman</em>, the Oregon lumber magazine  out of Portland. </p>
