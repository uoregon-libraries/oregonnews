<p><em>The  Madras pioneer</em><br />
  [LCCN:  sn84024878] <br />
  Madras,  Crook County/Jefferson County,   Oregon <br />
  1904-current</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Born in a tent six years before the City of Madras was  incorporated in 1910, the <em>Madras Pioneer</em> [LCCN: sn84024878] was the first newspaper to be published in Crook County. (Jefferson  County was created from Crook County territory in 1914.) Drawn to the Central  Oregon high desert by railroad development and homestead notices, Oregon  newspaper veteran Timothy Brownhill, with assistance from printer Bill Rutter,  founded the paper on August 25, 1904, using an old Washington hand-press and a  collection of nondescript type purchased from John Cradlebaugh, editor of <em>The Dalles Mountaineer </em>[LCCN: sn83025135].  The <em>Pioneer</em> began as a six-column  folio, published every Thursday at $1.50 for a year&rsquo;s subscription. </p>
<p>In 1905, Brownhill sold the paper to Max Lueddemann, founder  of the <em>Bend Bulletin</em> [LCCN: sn96088235].  Howard W. Turner bought the <em>Pioneer</em> in  1908 and published until 1915 with the help of printer Sidney Percival. In  1915, Vine W. Pearce, of McMinnville, ran the paper with his sons George and  Lot until 1919, when Pearce sold the paper to William E. Johnson, who then sold  it to George Pearce in 1920. However, Johnson took over again in 1923 under  lease from Vine Pearce. When a fire swept through the town in September of  1924, the <em>Pioneer</em> press was one of  the only buildings spared.  </p>
<p>Johnson published the <em>Pioneer</em> until his death on December 31, 1924, and on New Year&rsquo;s Day of 1925, Johnson&rsquo;s widow  took over and bought the paper that year. Mrs. Johnson relocated the <em>Pioneer</em> to a different building in 1929,  sharing space with the Pacific Telephone and Telegraph Company and the Pacific  Power and Light Company. As a woman publisher, Mrs. Johnson often experienced  frustration and sexism from printers that &ldquo;&lsquo;would not take orders from a  woman&rsquo;&rdquo; (quoted in Turnbull 1939, 447). However, with help from the Oregon  Editorial Association, Mrs. Johnson was able to find printers that were willing  to work with her. Mechanical aspects of printing were supervised by W. B. Russell, and in 1933, Mrs.  Johnson&rsquo;s daughter, Mrs. Betty J. Welker, took over as editor. In 1935, Mrs.  Johnson married A. R. Bowen,  previous representative for the Mergenthaler Linotype Company in the Northwest.  Bowen, with the help of former Eugene and Portland printer J.R. Blakely, ran the <em>Pioneer</em> for the next two years before Mrs. Johnson-Bowen took charge again. </p>
<p>Early <em>Pioneer</em> topics included international, national, statewide and local news, social  updates, reports on new buildings and construction, stories illustrating moral  lessons, sections titled &ldquo;Sheer Nonsense&rdquo; and &ldquo;Jolly Joker,&rdquo; featuring jokes  and amusing dialogues, &ldquo;Science and Invention,&rdquo;   &ldquo;Farm and Garden,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Papers by the People.&rdquo; Fashion was presented as  important to women, and women&rsquo;s roles, behavior, marriage, and voting rights  were discussed primarily in editorials. Political  cartoons, poems, and short stories intermingled with news of national politics  and coverage on presidential candidates. One cartoon from 1911 featured a woman  telling a little girl that she could be president someday, with the caption,  &ldquo;In the Good Times Coming.&rdquo;  </p>
<p>News coverage on the Warm Springs Indian Reservation  often expressed Native American grievances, and the <em>Pioneer</em> published  reports on Native American celebrations, as well as projects such as Geoffrey O&rsquo;Hara&rsquo;s  preservation of the music of &ldquo;the original Americans, who are rapidly  passing to the Happy Hunting Ground,&rdquo; as reported in 1913. </p>
<p>As early as 1909, the <em>Pioneer </em>boasted Madras as the &ldquo;Gateway to central Oregon,&rdquo; and  prophesized the city as &ldquo;sure to be the railroad center&rdquo; of the region,  encouraging people to invest in local property and businesses. However, the railroad construction boom declined  around 1911 (Crow and Ramsey 2010, 346). The <em>Pioneer</em> is still in print today, featuring sections on local news,  sports, community updates, and classifieds. The current paper is published on  Wednesdays by Eagle Newspapers, with a circulation of over 4,000. </p>
