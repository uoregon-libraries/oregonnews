<p><em>Heppner Herald </em><em><br />
  </em>[LCCN: sn97071037] <br />
  Heppner,  Morrow County, Or.<br />
1914-1924</p>
<p>The <em>Heppner Herald</em>, an independent  newspaper, was founded in April of 1914 by L.K. Harlan (formerly of Condon and  Ione) who served as the manager, and E.G. Harlan as the editor. The newspaper  served Heppner, Oregon and nearby communities and rural areas. The <em>Herald </em>was published semi-weekly for  approximately three months under Harlan and was issued on a weekly or bi-weekly  schedule at varying periods for the remainder of its run. Â The newspaper started with a $1.50 annual  subscription rate. Shortly after establishing the <em>Herald</em>, Harlan sold his interest in the <em>Ione Bulletin</em> [LCCN: sn97071036], located approximately 18 miles  southeast of Heppner in Ione, and reduced the <em>Herald</em>&rsquo;s annual subscription rate to $1.00, likely hoping to entice  Ione subscribers to switch to his recently founded newspaper. The <em>Herald</em>, using a Model K Linotype, was a  primary competitor with the <em>Heppner  Gazette-Times</em> [LCCN: sn97071038] for 10 years, from its founding until its  dissolution in 1924.</p>
<p>The <em>Herald</em> was an anti-prohibition newspaper  reportedly backed by liquor interests upon its establishment in 1914. With the  passing of the Anderson Act, which instituted prohibition in Oregon, Harlan  turned the paper over to Pierce and Fletcher Printing in late 1915. Prohibition  took effect a short time later on January 1, 1916. George T. Pierce managed the  newspaper until February 27, 1917 when he sold to S.A. Pattison, an experienced  newspaper man from Castle Rock, Oregon, who took over publishing the newspaper  on the first of March 1917. Under Pierce and Pattison&rsquo;s management, the <em>Heppner Herald</em> provided the community  with information regarding society and culture, agriculture, and local  religious organizations.</p>
<p>In early  July of 1918, a major fire broke out in downtown Heppner, destroying four and  one-half city blocks comprised of 17 businesses and 30 residences, causing an  estimated $200,000 in damage. The uninsured <em>Heppner  Herald </em>printing office was completely destroyed, but the business records  were saved, and Pattison, the editor, released the July 4 issue only one day  late on Friday July 5.</p>
<p>During the  period immediately following the devastating fire, the <em>Herald</em> was printed in several news offices located in adjacent  communities. Within a week, the newspaper was published in tabloid form at the <em>Gazette-Times</em> office with the assistance  of &ldquo;Mr. Crawford and the <em>Gazette-Times</em> force.&rdquo; Later that month, the newspaper relocated to Ione until a suitable  location for the replacement office could be found. By October 11, 1918, Pattison  had successfully purchased a replacement printing press and moved the <em>Herald</em> printing operation back to Heppner.  The 8x12 printing press was replaced with a &ldquo;late model 10x15 Chandler and  Price, the standard job printing press of the world.&rdquo; Upon its return to  Heppner, the <em>Herald</em> continued to  publish until ceasing operations following the April 15, 1924 issue, at which  point the newspaper was sold to Vawter and Spencer Crawford of the <em>Heppner Gazette-Times</em>.</p>
