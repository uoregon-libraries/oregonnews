<p><em>Oregon  Free Press</em><br />
  [LCCN:  sn84022661]<br />
  Oregon  City, Clackamas County,   Oregon <br />
  1848-1848</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oregon City, established along the Columbia River near  Willamette Falls in 1829 as the first incorporated city west of the Rocky  Mountains, was not only the home of the short-lived <em>Oregon Free Press</em> [LCCN: sn84022661], it was also the birthplace of  the first newspaper to be produced west of the Missouri River – the <em>Oregon Spectator</em> [LCCN: sn84022662], founded  on February 5, 1846, 13 years before Oregon became a state. </p>
<p>The <em>Oregon Free Press</em> was founded in 1848 by George L. Curry as a protest paper in opposition to the <em>Spectator</em>, under the motto, &ldquo;Here shall  the Press the people&rsquo;s rights maintain, un-awed by influence, and un-bribed by  gain.&rdquo; Curry, originally from Philadelphia, had worked as editor and  co-publisher of the <em>Saint Louis Reveille </em>[LCCN:  sn83025403] in 1843. He came to Oregon in 1846 via the Cow Creek Canyon route  and became editor of the <em>Spectator</em>,  through which he hoped to promote &ldquo;&lsquo;temperance, morality, science, and  intelligence,&rdquo; allowing equal access and expression of all views in the paper&rsquo;s  columns. However, on January 28, 1848, Curry was dismissed from the <em>Spectator</em> for refusing to promote the  sole interests of Oregon&rsquo;s first governor, George Abernethy.</p>
<p>A poem in the second issue of the <em>Free Press</em> described Curry&rsquo;s sentiment: &ldquo;When grasping tyranny  offends, or angry bigots frown; When rulers plot for selfish ends, to keep the  people down; When statesmen form unholy league, to drive the world to war; When  knaves in palaces intrigue for ribbons or a star; We raise our heads, survey  their deeds, and cheerily reply – Grub, little moles, grub underground; There&rsquo;s  sunshine in the sky!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Starting a newspaper in the pioneer days of Oregon was no easy  task; the printing plant for the <em>Spectator</em> had been transported all the way from the Atlantic coast. To create the <em>Free Press</em>, Curry ordered a press to be  built of wood in Oregon City by local machinist Victor M. Wallace, rather than  waiting for one to arrive from the East. He obtained 80 pounds of type from  Catholic missionaries who had been printing in French and were lacking the  letter &ldquo;W&rdquo;. Curry often used two of the letter &ldquo;V&rdquo; to make a &ldquo;W,&rdquo; and  eventually whittled his own out of hardwood. Readers could pay $3.50 for a  year&rsquo;s subscription, with &ldquo;currency and produce taken at their cash value.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <em>Free Press</em> was  only 7.5x15 inches in size, and contained four pages, with two columns on each  page. A small number of advertisements for new goods and supplies were  published with each paper in card form, often including ads for Curry as a  manufacturing jeweler. News stories and notices often omitted detailed  information that is considered essential in modern journalism. Several issues  contained history of Oregon settlements, local events and news, reports of army  activity, poems, opinions, and updates on relations with Native Americans. One  of the first issues gives notice to correspondents to keep in mind the paper&rsquo;s  small size and shape by condensing thought and expression and keeping ideas  &ldquo;perspicuous&rdquo; for effective compositions.</p>
<p>News of the French and Italian revolutions, U.S. immigration  policies, trade routes, politics, and elections are among the topics discussed  in the <em>Free Press</em>, as well as commentary  on the unfavorable legal system in Oregon at the time and other grievances.  Announcements were made for gatherings and ladies&rsquo; meetings, and opinion  columns and letters expressed a number of different views. One letter from a  local man asserted that &ldquo;Oregon…may rejoice that she has within her borders a  flock of independent females to warn her of danger,&rdquo; advising men that &ldquo;you  must either defend your country and the gals or drag out your days in the rusty  halls of bachelorship.&rdquo; The writer then went on to beg pardon for comparing women  to geese. </p>
<p>The <em>Free Press</em> only ran from April 8, 1848 to October of the same year, due to the outflow of  subscribers to the gold mines of California. Five years after the <em>Free Press </em>suspended, Curry was  appointed as secretary of the interior for Oregon territory, and became one of  the youngest governors of Oregon in 1854. From 1861 to 1863, Curry worked with Stephen  J. McCormick on the publication of the <em>Portland  Daily Advertiser</em> [LCCN: sn84022664], Oregon&rsquo;s second oldest daily paper.</p>
