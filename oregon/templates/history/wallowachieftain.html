   <p><em>Wallowa County  Chieftain</em><br/>
    [LCCN: sn96088042]<br/>
Enterprise, Or.<br/>
1909-19??</p>
   <p>The <em>Wallowa Chieftain</em> [LCCN: sn94052752] was first launched in Joseph, Oregon, on May 15, 1884, by a  group of local businessmen headed by Frank D. McCully.  The <em>Chieftain</em> began as a six-column, four-page weekly distributed on Thursdays at $2.00 for a  year&rsquo;s subscription, serving the communities of Joseph and Enterprise in the  newly founded Wallowa County.</p>
<p>
  In part, the paper functioned as a sounding board for  regional economic boosterism.   McCully  remained in the background as a financial backer for two years before formally  taking a position as manager, conducting the paper until 1892. In 1893, Editor Ernest  Duerselen oversaw the transfer of the <em>Chieftain</em> to the town of Enterprise, a political move by local Republicans designed to  check the influence of Wallowa&rsquo;s Populist party. Soon after, William E. Beers  took over publication, replacing Duerselen with Frank A. Clarke, but  maintaining the paper&rsquo;s political opposition to the Populists until 1896. </p>
   <p>
   The <em>Chieftain</em> reported national and international news in addition to local bulletins through  the use of press ready-prints. In 1884, the front page featured women&rsquo;s,  children&rsquo;s, and editor&rsquo;s columns, poems, short stories, and advertisements. By  1888, the paper expanded to eight pages. McCully added a regular &ldquo;Women and  Home&rdquo; section in 1892 that highlighted the habits of Victorian women. By 1902,  the <em>Chieftain</em> included a serialized  fiction segment that featured sections of popular novels by authors such as  Arthur Conan Doyle. In 1909, women&rsquo;s fashion became a mainstay of the &ldquo;Women&rsquo;s  Realm&rdquo; column and the &ldquo;Farm and Garden&rdquo; section provided gardening tips to the <em>Chieftain&rsquo;s</em> readers.</p>
   <p> 
   The <em>Wallowa Chieftain</em> downplayed issues of race and ethnicity in the early editions. In  advertisements, Chinese immigrants were depicted as foreign, exotic  practitioners of &ldquo;celestial&rdquo; medicine and science. However, the paper&rsquo;s report  of the massacre of Chinese miners at nearby Hells Canyon in 1887 appeared  sympathetic to the victims. Though the paper was named after Chief Joseph of  the Nez Perce, coverage of Native American issues was thin and ambivalent, and  Chief Joseph&rsquo;s public request to resettle in the Wallowa Valley in 1900 was met  by a reluctant <em>Chieftain</em> which urged  that Joseph not be allowed to return.  </p>
   <p>
   From 1896 to 1902, the <em>Chieftain</em> was co-managed by Carl Roe and Levi J. Rouse. Roe conducted the paper  independently for another two years until he sold to publisher Ben Weathers in  1904. After four years, Weathers sold the <em>Chieftain</em> to the owners of <em>Enterprise News-Record</em> [LCCN: sn96088044], former Enterprise competitors, who then published the <em>Chieftain</em> alongside their existing  paper.  Co-publication lasted until June  of 1911 when the <em>News-Record</em> merged  with the recently renamed <em>Wallowa County Chieftain</em> [LCCN: sn96088042] to become the <em>Enterprise</em> <em>Record Chieftain </em>[LCCN: sn96088041].  Owners Homer A. Galloway and Snow V. Heaton then sold the paper to Kansas City  editor George P. Cheney in November 1911.   Cheney operated the paper as the <em>Enterprise  Record Chieftain</em> until changing the name to <em>Enterprise Chieftain</em> [LCCN: sn96088047] in 1938. Since 1943, the  press has continued publication to the present as the <em>Wallowa County Chieftain </em>[LCCN: sn90057139].</p>
