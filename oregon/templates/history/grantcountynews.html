<p><em>Grant  County news </em><br />
  [LCCN:  sn85042403] <br />
  Canyon  City, Grant County, Ore. <br />
1879-1908</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Canyon City&rsquo;s <em>Grant  County News </em>[LCCN: sn85042403] is the descendant of Grant County&rsquo;s first newspaper, <em>The City Journal </em>[LCCN: sn84022648],  first issued in 1868 by R.H.J. Comer,  who served as editor and publisher for the tiny semi-occasional paper. In the  early 1870s, the paper&rsquo;s name changed to the <em>Canyon City Express </em>[LCCN: unknown],  and then to the <em>Grant County Express</em> [LCCN: sn96088260]. Complete files of these early publications were later  destroyed in a fire.</p>
<p>When Henry R. Gale of Roseburg became editor in 1876, the  title was changed to <em>The</em> <em>Grant County Times</em> [LCCN: sn96088261].  In 1879, S.H. Shepherd bought the  paper and changed the title to the <em>Grant  County News</em>, an Independent paper published on Saturdays at $3.00 per  year&rsquo;s subscription. One of the first issues published by Shepherd describes  him as &ldquo;a young man of untiring energy, good ability as a writer and especially  so as a fair minded chronicler of local events…anxious to improve the county  through the influence of  his columns,  and as such deserves the undivided support of the people of Grant county.&rdquo; Under  Shepherd&rsquo;s ownership, H.J. Neal, W.C. McFadden, and J.T. Donnelly served as editors. </p>
<p>Early issues of the <em>News</em> included entertaining stories from Grant County and elsewhere, prospects of new  railroad lines, and political and governmental happenings. In the 1860s and  1870s, former Eugene newspaperman Joaquin Miller, known as the &ldquo;poet of the  Sierras,&rdquo; frequently contributed to the Canyon City paper, and later became a  judge for Grant County.<br />
  The <em>News</em> did not try to mask racial, ethnic,  and cultural tensions. In the October 15, 1885 issue it was reported: &ldquo;To everyone  it is apparent that the Chinese are a curse and a blight to this county, not  only financially, but socially and morally.&rdquo; The paper went on to openly  congratulate a woman from The Dalles for pushing Chinese residents out of town  with her new laundry business. The <em>News</em> also contained reports of potential &ldquo;Indian outbreaks&rdquo; and referred to Native  Americans as &ldquo;savages.&rdquo; An issue from 1880 featured an open letter to the  governor, from the citizens of Grant County, pointing out their isolation and  need for government protection from &ldquo;the wiley schemes and murderous practices  of [the] Indian population.&rdquo;  </p>
<p>The <em>News</em> included  a few stories and columns written by women, mostly focusing on responsibilities  in the home and relationships with men. One brief article revealed that when  seeking a man, &ldquo;Grant County maidens ask if he owns any Monumental [Mining  Company] or Phil Sheridan stock, and if he has subscribed to the <em>Grant County News</em>.&rdquo; Advertisements  directed at women promoted fashionable clothing and sewing machines.</p>
<p>D.I. Asbury took  ownership of the <em>News</em> on July 27,  1886, switching publication to Thursday mornings. Issues from 1888 included  mining news, correspondence from the National capital, poems and fiction with  basic illustrations, and commentary on local politics and election news.  As of 1889, Asbury claimed that the <em>News</em> &ldquo;goes into almost every home in  Grant County and is read by all, both old and young.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1898, Asbury sold the paper to Perry Chandler and Robert  Glen, and then Glen sold his interest to Charles J. McIntosh<strong> </strong>in 1903. McIntosh stayed with the <em>News</em> for five years before becoming a  professor of industrial editing at Oregon State Agricultural College. </p>
<p>In 1908, University of Oregon law school graduate Clinton P.  Haight, purchased McIntosh&rsquo;s share of the paper, forming the Chandler &amp;  Haight firm. Chandler &amp; Haight purchased the <em>Canyon City Blue Mountain Eagle</em> [LCCN: sn96088262], previously  published in Long Creek, and merged the <em>News</em> under the <em>Blue Mountain Eagle</em> title, which continues to be published to this day from John Day,  Oregon.</p>
