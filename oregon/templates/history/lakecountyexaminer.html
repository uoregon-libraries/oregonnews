<p><em>Lake  County examiner</em><br />
  [LCCN:  sn97071141]<br />
  Lakeview,  Lake County,  Oregon <br />
  1880-1915</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The southern Oregon town of Lakeview, established in 1876, served  as the perfect central location for early commercial sheep and cattle raising,  and developed into an agricultural and logging town now sometimes referred to  as &ldquo;Oregon&rsquo;s Outback.&rdquo; At 4,798 feet in elevation, Lakeview is known as &ldquo;the  tallest town in Oregon&rdquo; (Town of Lakeview). </p>
<p>The <em>Lake County  Examiner</em> [LCCN: sn97071141] was launched by Charles A. Cogswell and Stephen  P. Moss as a weekly paper, with Frank Coffin as editor. The early issues of the <em>Examiner</em> were printed in extremely small  type, and as a good representation of journalism at the time, the front page often  featured anecdotes, fiction, and feature stories as opposed to actual news. The  paper was offered for $3.00 a year, or $2.50 if paid in advance.</p>
<p>After a few years, the <em>Examiner</em> obtained an Eight-Medium Gordon-Franklin job press and a wide variety of type.  An issue from 1882 claimed that the <em>Examiner</em> &ldquo;is the organ of no person, clique, or corporation; will always be found ready  and willing to advocate any measure tending to advance the interest of the  county at large and express its opinion upon all matters within its province  without fear or favor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Around 1883, the <em>State  Line Herald</em> [LCCN: sn93051667], established in 1878 as Lakeview&rsquo;s first  newspaper and first publication in southern Oregon west of the Cascades, merged  under the <em>Examiner </em>title, and the  paper adopted Republican politics. A number of partners took ownership of the <em>Examiner</em> in the 1880s: Fuller Snelling and Charles Cogswell in 1884, Bruce Allen and  Frank W. Beach in 1885, and Beach &amp; Beach in 1886, comprised of Frank W.  Beach, who later conducted the <em>Portland  Pacific Northwest Hotel News</em> [LCCN:unknown],  and Seneca C. Beach, who had moved from Iowa to Oregon in 1881 and worked with  Joseph A. Bowdoin to publish the first issue of Klamath Falls&rsquo; first newspaper,  the <em>Linkville Weekly Star </em>[LCCN: sn99063818],  of which he became editor and publisher in 1891. </p>
<p>The great Lakeview fire of May 22, 1900, took its toll on  the buildings, businesses, and newspapers of the Lakeview district, but the <em>Examiner</em> was able to save enough  material and equipment to put out an extra edition the next day and lend its  equipment to the <em>Lake County Rustler</em> [LCCN: sn97071139], a local People&rsquo;s party newspaper that had been established  in 1895. </p>
<p>A few years after the fire, the <em>Examiner</em> expanded into an eight paged paper, 26x40 inches in size,  with eight columns to a page.  Issues  from the early 1900s featured political cartoons and a regular &ldquo;Candidate  Column&rdquo; for political candidates, as well as opinions on legal decisions and  economic disparages. Advice and opinions on women&rsquo;s fashion and beauty notes  appeared frequently, and columns &ldquo;for the housewife&rdquo; were intermingled with  articles claiming that &ldquo;college educated women make the finest mothers,&rdquo;  written by a woman, and &ldquo;The Ballot is Woman&rsquo;s Right,&rdquo; written by a man. The <em>Examiner</em> printed numerous short stories  written by men and women, as well as poems, land and mining notices, county  news, announcements for community meetings, and business prospects for Lake  County, &ldquo;The future garden spot of the Northwest.&rdquo; </p>
<p>In 1905, C. Oscar Metzker took over the publication and had  a linotype installed. In 1911, Fred P. Cronemiller and his family, founders of  the <em>Klamath Falls Evening Herald</em> [LCCN: sn99063812], purchased the <em>Examiner</em>.  Upon his father&rsquo;s death in 1924, G.D.  Cronemiller, took over as editor and continued with the publication until  October 24, 1935, when C.J. Gillette and Hugh McGilvra of Forest Grove purchased the paper. </p>
