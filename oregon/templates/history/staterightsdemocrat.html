<p><em>The State Rights Democrat</em><br>
[LCCN: sn84022644] <br>
Albany, Linn County, Or. <br>
1865-1900 </p>
<p>Drawing on the pro-slavery ideology associated with Civil War Democrats,the<em> State Rights Democrat </em>of Albany, Oregon, was one of Linn County&rsquo;s most vociferous political papers.  Its forerunners, the <em>Oregon</em> <em>Democrat</em> [LCCN: sn96088479] and <em>Albany Inquirer </em>[LCCN: sn96088499], were both suppressed for political reasons, the former by General Wright of the U.S. Army&rsquo;s Department of the Pacific.  The<em> State Rights Democrat </em>originated in 1865 with James O&rsquo;Meara as editor.  O&rsquo;Meara was no stranger to suppression of the press, having been forced out as owner and editor of the <em>Oregon Sentinel </em>[LCCN: sn84022657] by Republican sympathizers in 1861. </p>
<p>A number of owners and editors worked on the <em>Democrat</em> after O&rsquo;Meara&rsquo;s departure in 1866.  Charles Bellinger, of the <em>Salem Oregon Arena</em> [LCCN: sn00063663] and later the <em>Portland News </em>[LCCN: sn86063742], co-owned the <em>State Rights Democrat </em>for a time, leaving in 1870.  Bellinger, like other figures associated with the paper, pursued a career in local politics that would draw him away from publishing.  Fred P. Nutting had a hand in the enterprise from 1882 to1912, changing the paper&rsquo;s name to the <em>Albany Democrat </em>[LCCN: sn96088449] after he joined.  The paper would later be consolidated with the <em>Albany Evening Herald </em>[LCCN: sn96088291], eventually becoming the <em>Albany Democrat-Herald </em>[LCCN: sn96088460] in 1925.        </p>
<p>The <em>State Rights</em> <em>Democrat</em> featured ads for lawyers, notaries, various stores, and a few breweries among other goods and services.  Advertisements appeared next to articles of a partisan nature.  One article proclaimed, &ldquo;We need to commit to the Democracy&rdquo; in order to correct &ldquo;abolition rule.&rdquo;  Although the paper was quick to denounce Republicans, it also criticized Democrats.  In an attack on previous editor O&rsquo;Meara, the<em> Democrat </em>drew attention to factionalism within Oregon&rsquo;s Democratic Party, warning, &ldquo;He will do anything and everything to create and foster dissensions in the Democratic household.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The partisan tone of the paper often resulted in disputes with nearby editors from papers such as the<em> Daily American Unionist </em>[LCCN: sn94052331] and the<em> Oregon Statesman </em>[LCCN: sn83025131], the latter being dismissed as an &ldquo;abolitionist&rdquo; organ.  Charges in such disputes ranged from misinformation to embezzlement and outright fraud, rarely producing calm discourse between the respective editors. </p>
However, the <em>Democrat</em>&rsquo;s content was not confined to parochial political disagreements.  Moving beyond the local stage, the paper ran an article titled, &ldquo;Grant&rsquo;s Indian Policy,&rdquo; which suggested that President Ulysses S. Grant&rsquo;s Peace Policy and employ of Quaker agents were ineffective in maintaining non-violent control of tribes throughout the country.  Writing in reference to violence in Oklahoma at Fort Sill, the paper concluded, &ldquo;In our own unfortunate Territory, men, women and children have been roasted to death; impaled upon thorny plants and trees, but the Fort Sill affair is one of the most horrid we have ever described.&rdquo;  Another piece recounted a lecture given by Reverend Robert Patterson, who sought to discredit Darwinism by arguing that humans have always been civilized and never could have evolved from &ldquo;monkeys.&rdquo;  Lighter pieces focused on topics such as the importance of naps, Oregon&rsquo;s healthful climate, and the need of farmers to combat weeds.
