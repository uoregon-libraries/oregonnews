<p>Launched in 1866 by DeWitt  Clinton Ireland, the <em>Oregon City  Enterprise</em> is one of the earliest established newspapers in Oregon,  chronicling 83 years of &ldquo;the Pioneer City at the Falls of the Willamette.&rdquo;  A study through the paper&rsquo;s pages illustrates  the journey from &ldquo;the pioneer Oregon of yesterday to the comfortable, modern  Oregon of today&rdquo; as told through the publication&rsquo;s changing editors, political  affiliation and name.  The <em>Enterprise</em> &ldquo;always stood for the  betterment of the town, county and state&rdquo; even if it was rather conventional in  spirit.</p>
<p>DeWitt Clinton Ireland, born on the fourth of July, 1836 in  Vermont, was a rather remarkable character in the field of Oregon journalism   His newspaper career, a lifelong commitment, stretched  from coast to coast. His obituary, from the January 12, 1913 edition of the <em>Sunday Oregonian</em> [LCCN: sn83045782], stated  that he had worked for the Mishawaka<em> Free  Press </em>[LCCN: unknown] (later known as the Mishawaka <em>Enterprise</em> [LCCN: sn84037951]) in Indiana and the Detroit <em>Free Press </em>[LCCN: sn83016680] in  Michigan, and he was one of the few typesetters who could decipher Horace  Greeley&rsquo;s notorious handwriting at the New York <em>Tribune </em>[LCCN: sn83030280].  After  coming to Oregon in 1861, Ireland worked on the The Dalles <em>Daily Mountaineer </em>[LCCN: sn89055266] until 1865 when he moved to  Oregon City where he edited the <em>Morning  Oregonian</em> [LCCN: sn83025138].</p>
<p>In order to promote the  interests of Oregon City in conjuncture with a proposed railroad line coming  through town, Ireland established the <em>Oregon  City Enterprise</em> [LCCN: sn84022660] with the first issue appearing on  Saturday, October 27, 1866.  The  publication was originally a four-page, seven-column weekly that cost readers  $3.00 for a year subscription.  In his  salutatory, Ireland was one of the first to declare himself a &ldquo;<em>news</em> rather than <em>political</em> type of editor.&rdquo;  However,  when politics did seep into the <em>Enterprise</em> Ireland took a strictly Democratic stance.</p>
<p>The earliest issues of the <em>Enterprise</em> were standard fare for the time  period.  Clipped miscellany constituted  the bulk of news stories since little value was placed on &ldquo;editorial services.&rdquo;  At this early point in Oregon journalism, &ldquo;editors  and publishers were, for the most part, printers or perhaps lawyers [and] copy  was largely &lsquo;reprint.&rsquo;&rdquo;  The paper,  consequently, carried little local news at the start.  However, one of the more interesting items to  come out of the early <em>Enterprise</em> is  one of the state&rsquo;s first newspaper coverage of a baseball game:  the Portland Pioneers beat the Clackamas Nine  77 to 45 on October 13, 1866. </p>
<p>On July 13, 1867, the paper increased  to eight columns to accommodate increased advertising but would return to seven  in a few years&rsquo; time.  The paper carried  the typical advertisements for &ldquo;cure-alls&rdquo; and local merchants.  There were also announcements from the  pioneer stage companies of the 1850s and &lsquo;60s.   One such ad touted a low fare ride between Salem and Portland, only  $5.00, while another boasted about comfortable new coaches.</p>
<p>On October 17, 1868, the <em>Enterprise</em> announced that the paper would  move to Union County, to issue out of La Grande.  After some confusion with paperwork, the <em>Enterprise</em> remained in Oregon City and a  month later, on November 14, the paper returned as the <em>Weekly Enterprise</em> [LCCN: sn85042452].  This new iteration of the paper, which  continued to be published on Saturday, claimed to be an &ldquo;Independent Paper for  the Business Man, the Farmer and the Family Circle.&rdquo;  Contents remained the same and covered  stories such as the &ldquo;manufacture of the telegraph cable&rdquo; to connect France with  the United States in 1868.  On August 7,  1869 John Myers and D. M. McKenney took over as publishers and, unlike Ireland,  were all too anxious to make the <em>Enterprise</em> a political paper.</p>
<p>The following year, Anthony &ldquo;Tony&rdquo;  Noltner, a German immigrant, purchased the paper and began editing the <em>Enterprise </em>on June 18, 1870.  Noltner started his newspaper career in  Oregon as the &ldquo;devil&rdquo; in the office of the Corvallis <em>Occidental Messenger</em> [LCCN: sn96088331].  It was said that Noltner &ldquo;was known by all  newspaper men in the state, and by nearly everybody else.&rdquo;  Noltner remained at the helm of the paper for  the next five years.</p>
<p>On November 10, 1871 the <em>Weekly Enterprise</em> assumed its former  title and was once again published as the <em>Oregon  City Enterprise</em> [LCCN: sn94052321].   On October 29, 1875, in a rather curt notice, Noltner stated, &ldquo;With this  issue the <em>Enterprise</em> commences its  tenth volume.  We have no regrets to  recount for the past nor promises to make for the future, consequently we shall  not trouble our readers with a lengthy article on what we shall do in time  come.&rdquo;  It was at this point that Noltner,  who no longer wished to be associated with a political paper, sold the <em>Enterprise,</em> and Frank S. Dement, a native  of Oregon City, became editor and publisher the following issue. Dement, vowed  to make the <em>Enterprise</em> &ldquo;eminently a  newspaper, and not pander to the interest of any party.&rdquo;  However, under Dement&rsquo;s editorship, the <em>Enterprise </em>would become a Republican  sheet, remaining so until the paper&rsquo;s discontinuation in 1950.  </p>
<p>John Rock succeeded Dement in  1879 as editor.  Between 1879 and 1881  the paper increased from four to eight pages.   During this time, a &ldquo;Local Matters&rdquo; column appeared, focusing on the  lives of local residents and other home-grown topics.  For example, from the September 22, 1881  column, readers learn that the Pope Brothers finished a new tin roof and Curtis  Beals recovered nicely from typhoid fever.  </p>
<p>In 1884, J. A. White replaced  Dement as editor, and on January 2, 1887, Edward McKeever Rands, later a  Washington state senator, began editing the <em>Oregon  City Enterprise</em>.  By 1888, the paper  was once again eight pages and was now printing as the <em>Enterprise</em> [LCCN: sn94052322].   Formatting was always somewhat inconsistent with the <em>Enterprise</em> and the paper frequently  experimented with the number and size of pages and columns.  For example, in 1889 the paper was an  eight-page, five-column sheet, but the following year it used a four-page,  eight-column layout.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1889, Rands  sold the <em>Enterprise</em> to Charles  Meserve, who would be editor for the next nine years.  On April 3, 1891, Meserve changed the name of  the paper back to the <em>Oregon City  Enterprise</em> [LCCN: sn00063700] yet again.   Oregon City at this point was constructing several new subdivisions to  accommodate the increasing population of the town.  People were moving to the city to work in the  firmly established industrial areas and the <em>Enterprise</em> saw a steady increase in patronage.</p>
<p>After the tragic death of his  wife and infant child, Meserve sold the <em>Enterprise</em> to a group of businessmen who in turn sold it to Leslie L. Porter, a &ldquo;lawyer  who gave up his practice to become an editor.&rdquo;   Porter saw the introduction of linotype to the <em>Enterprise</em> which was a great improvement over the &ldquo;letter-by-letter&rdquo;  typesetting and allowed for much faster printing.  The <em>Enterprise</em> went through a slew of owners in 1906 and 1907 until finally Edward E. Brodie  became editor and proprietor on February 7, 1908.</p>
<p>Brodie had left the competing  paper, the <em>Oregon City Courier </em>[LCCN:  sn00063698], to take on the editorship of the <em>Enterprise</em>.  Brodie, who  already had a colorful career in journalism at that point, remained with the  paper for the next three decades and proved to be an exceedingly capable editor.  In 1911, Brodie established the <em>Morning Enterprise </em>[LCCN: sn00063701], a  daily that first appeared on January 8.   The weekly continued to be published as the <em>Oregon City Enterprise,</em> and the daily was published until 1933.  Brodie had also steadily enlarged the  printing plant that produced the weekly and daily <em>Enterprise,</em> and by 1916 it was considered &ldquo;one of the best  all-around printing establishments in the state outside of Portland [and was]  capable of making anything from rubber stamps to circus posters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During his time as  editor-in-chief, Brodie was also an official ambassador to Siam (1921-1925),  what is now Thailand, and Finland (1930-1933) and would often take extended  trips overseas to attend to his governmental duties.  When Brodie was in Siam, Hal E. Hoss managed  the <em>Enterprise,</em> and when in Finland,  Harry B. Cartlidge was editor of the paper.</p>
<p>Brodie remained publisher until  January 1, 1935, at which point he sold the <em>Enterprise</em> only to repurchase the paper in 1938.   Brodie died the following year, widely mourned, of a heart attack in the  Oregon state capitol.  Walter W. R. May then  acquired paper in October of 1943.  May  would publish and edit the <em>Enterprise</em> until March 1, 1950 when it merged with the <em>Banner-Courier</em> [LCCN: sn00063699] and became the <em>Enterprise-Courier </em>[LCCN: sn00063703].  May became the  editor-in-chief of the new publication, which enjoyed a long and popular  presence in the community and was published until the 1990s.</p>
