<p>The <em>West Shore</em> [LCCN:  2012260361]<em>, </em>Oregon&rsquo;s first  illustrated publication, was well beyond its time in terms of scope, quality  and illustrative nature.  The paper started  as a booster magazine for the region, encouraging immigration by proudly promoting  the seemingly limitless resources and opportunities that existed in the  Northwest.  The <em>West Shore </em>also distinguished itself from competitors by  emphasizing regional literature and art.   The initial success and unusual literary direction of the publication  can be attributed to its creator, Leopold Samuel, a German-Jewish immigrant who  worked as a newspaper boy in New York during his youth.</p>
<p>Samuel was an innovative and determined man.  After a series of successful advertising and  publishing endeavors in California, he moved to Portland around 1871 and began  printing &ldquo;alphabetical and illustrated Portland city directories.&rdquo;  This was an impressive undertaking  considering the amount of illustrations he would use, which were rare at the time  and considered a &ldquo;regional novelty&rdquo; due to the technical and costly efforts to  print them. </p>
<p>Samuel moved on to loftier goals with his eyes set on publishing a truly  literary paper, one that proudly exhibited all that the Northwest had to  offer.  On August 1, 1875, he printed the  first edition of the <em>West Shore </em>in  Portland, Oregon.  Samuel asserted in the  first issue that the <em>West Shore</em> was  to be full of writings from &ldquo;the brightest intellects and ablest writers in  this State&rdquo; and the publication would go on to play a very important role in  the development of early Pacific Northwest literature.  The <em>West  Shore</em> celebrated and encouraged literary expression and acted as a great  outlet for many early Oregon writers.  </p>
<p>Samuel wanted the <em>West Shore </em>to  act as a &ldquo;repository of the lives and acts of the pioneers and representative  men and women of Oregon and the North Pacific Coast,&rdquo; and indeed many early  settlers and statesmen wrote for the <em>West  Shore,</em> including Lindsay Applegate, an early pioneer, and Joseph Lane, the  first governor of the Oregon Territory.   Thomas Condon, noted geologist, and Joaquin Miller, the &ldquo;poet of the  Sierras,&rdquo; also contributed to the publication.   Women were also regular contributors; Ella Higginson had a column  entitled &ldquo;Fact and Fancy for Women&rdquo; in 1890, Frances Fuller Victor wrote on the  history of Oregon, and Belle W. Cooke submitted poetry.</p>
<p>Samuel was so dedicated to encouraging settlement in the region that land  owners were allowed to advertise farms and plots of land for sale free of  charge.  Samuel hired skilled artists to  create lithographic prints of &ldquo;public buildings, schools, churches, business  blocks and residences,&rdquo; in addition to prints of a general nature, to showcase  the regional architecture and encourage settlement and economic growth.  These detailed and high-quality images  provide a brilliant record of the built environment and offer a glimpse into  1880s life in the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>Besides a commitment to superior artwork, regional literature and promoting  the Northwest, the <em>West Shore </em>was also  devoted to exposing its readers to philosophy and science and dedicated some  space to horticulture, finances and humorous writings.  Major national events, like the assassination  of President Garfield in 1881, would dominate entire issues.  </p>
<p>Over the years as Oregon grew, less emphasis was placed on immigration  and travel news, and the paper itself underwent several iterations.  Generic woodcut prints were replaced by finer  lithographic prints of regional landmarks, and eventually the publication  utilized color illustrations.  Beginning  as an 8-page monthly publication in 1875, the <em>West Shore</em> increased to 32 pages in 1878 and 48 pages in 1884,  finally becoming a 72-page behemoth in 1887.   In September of 1889, the <em>West  Shore</em> was published every Saturday in Portland, Oregon and Spokane,  Washington.  In March of 1891, after  Samuel had left the paper, the <em>West Shore</em> became the <em>Illustrated West Shore</em> [LCCN:  2012260365] and would only survive until May of that same year.  </p>
<p>With each new iteration, the subscription price for the <em>West Shore</em> increased.  Originally set at $1.50 a year, in 1884 the  price increased to $2.00 a year.  At this  point, Samuel had established agencies for the <em>West Shore </em>in Europe, New Zealand and Canada in order to further  promote the Pacific Northwest and encourage immigration to the state.  Subscriptions sold for $2.25 a year in  foreign countries.  In 1887, the price  was increased again to $2.50.  The weekly  publication from 1889 cost $4.00 a year, the pricey subscription rate  contributing to the decline in the paper&rsquo;s sales.</p>
<p>Samuel&rsquo;s high standards, numerous color illustrations, and refusal to run  &ldquo;objectionable advertising,&rdquo; such as gimmicky medicinal products, led the <em>West Shore</em> to be a very well-respected,  albeit expensive, publication.  Within  three years, the <em>West Shore</em> had a circulation  of 8,160 which was by far the largest in the Pacific Northwest, and at its peak  the <em>West Shore </em>would have over 15,000  subscribers.  However, Samuel&rsquo;s &ldquo;artistic  and literary ideas were in advance of the business possibilities of the times&rdquo;  and on May 2, 1891 the paper was suspended.   Although somewhat short lived, the <em>West  Shore</em> nonetheless provided thousands of people with access to art,  literature, poetry and science; an incredible victory in the development of the  Pacific Northwest.</p>
