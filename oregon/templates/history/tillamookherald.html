<p><em>Tillamook Herald </em><br />
  [LCCN: sn99063850] <br />
  Tillamook, Tillamook County, Oregon<br />
  1896-1934</p>
<p>
The <em>Tillamook Herald </em>[LCCN:  sn99063850], formally established by R.M.  Watson in 1896, succeeded two previous attempts at political news coverage  in northwestern Oregon&rsquo;s coastal Tillamook County, and ownership of the paper  changed hands multiple times as the area experienced social and economic  growth. Dairy farms, creameries, and agricultural endeavors defined the early  economic activity of the county; the <em>Herald</em> featured monthly reports on milk production of leading cows and presented price  changes for Tillamook and rival Wisconsin cheese as front-page news (Toll 1978,  81). Logging also became a major economic operation in the area, although the <em>Herald </em>expressed concern that the  county&rsquo;s social routines would be disrupted by transient loggers and their  activities (Toll 1978, 82). As early as 1909, reports can be found on new local  buildings and roads, and as the population and commercial sector of Tillamook  grew, the <em>Herald</em> emphasized the need  for a larger formal body or chamber of commerce to unify commercial interests  and promote civic improvements in Tillamook (Toll 1978, 84). </p>
<p>The <em>Tillamook</em> <em>Western Watchtower </em>[LCCN: sn96088494]<em>,</em> first published in 1889 in political  resistance to the county&rsquo;s oldest paper, the <em>Tillamook Headlight </em>[LCCN: sn99063849], founded in 1888, provided a  weekly review of Republican politics, but printing quickly ceased due to  financial problems.  In 1892, John J.  Stoddard and photographer A.G. Reynolds acquired the printing plant and started the<em> Tillamook</em> <em>Advocate, </em>a politically  Independent weekly paper that became Republican in its views by 1894 under the  leadership of editor T.B. Handley.  R.M. Watson purchased the <em>Advocate </em>in 1895and continued with weekly printing after renaming the paper <em>Tillamook</em> <em>Herald </em>in 1896. Watson and his nephew, Rollie W. Watson, a  well-known realtor, insurance salesman, and later a local Republican  politician, were joint owners of the paper until Rollie assumed full ownership  in 1902. In 1907, journeymen printers Dolan  and Murphy bought the paper, but Rollie Watson took over again briefly in  1908, alternating control with promoter and salesman N.T. Pentreath. In 1909, Watson sold the <em>Herald</em> to Cloverdale newspaperman C.E. Trombley, who published two issues per week until 1922, when  the paper changed back to a once-weekly. Trombley sold the paper to Allan  McComb and Fred T. Mellinger in 1923, who incorporated as The Tillamook  Publishing Company.  In 1924, former  resident of Eugene and Oregon City, Arne G. Rae, purchased the <em>Herald</em> and continued to publish in  partnership with Mellinger until 1929, when he became field manager of the  Oregon State Editorial Association and faculty of the University of Oregon  School of Journalism. George Borden took over for Rae and continued to work with  Mellinger until 1934, when the <em>Herald</em> merged with the <em>Headlight</em>, creating  the <em>Tillamook</em> <em>Headlight-Herald </em>[LCCN: sn99063851], under the direction of Thomas  Walpole and D.M. DeCook. </p>
<p>Tillamook County remained predominantly Anglo-American  throughout the first half of the 20th century, with little to no African  American, Native American, and Asian populations through the 1930s. The largest  nationality group in the county was the Swiss, often successful dairy  farmers.  A surge in Klu Klux Klan (KKK)  membership in Oregon between 1921 and 1924 is apparent in the <em>Herald</em>; during a 1922 political  campaign, the paperpublished an  advertisement from the KKK, warning the public against private Catholic schools  and pushing an initiative for mandatory public school attendance to ensure a  moral, uniform education for all children. In 1924 the <em>Herald </em>reported that the mayor of Tillamook, himself a Klansman, presented  the city's key to the KKK and said it was a pleasure to welcome them to the  city (Eckard 1962, 64). </p>
<p>The <em>Herald</em>&rsquo;s original  printing plant contained a few cases of type, one small jobber, and one  Washington hand-press, and the paper acquired new type and machinery over time,  including a power cylinder press and a linotype. The <em>Herald</em> started as a seven-column folio, changed to a four-column  quarto, and then to a seven-column quarto. At the turn of the century, the  paper featured topics such as the &ldquo;By-laws of Tillamook Dairy Association&rdquo; and  coverage of the Republican Convention for upcoming elections.</p>
<p>Advertisements  can be found from the Tillamook Lumbering Company and the Pacific Navigation  Company, as well as local bakeries, drugstores, fish markets and independent  craftsmen.  In the early 1900s, several  prominent women of Tillamook served as compositors for the <em>Herald</em>, including Bell and Maude Wertz, Kate Plank, Maude Nolan,  Annie and Lottie Price, and Dora Donaldson. Women&rsquo;s contributions are reflected  in features such as the &ldquo;Home Circle Department&rdquo; column dedicated to mothers  and a segment entitled &ldquo;The Sunday School,&rdquo; as well as advertisements for women&rsquo;s  clothing and medicines such as Lydia E. Pinkham&rsquo;s Vegetable Compound and Peruna. </p>
<p>The Herald prided itself as &ldquo;A Paper Devoted to the  Interests of the People of Tillamook County,&rdquo; and published articles related to  farming and gardening in addition to local, state, national, and international  news and entertaining fiction continued from issue to issue such as Arthur  Conan Doyle&rsquo;s &ldquo;A Study in Scarlet.&rdquo; From 1924 to 1934, the <em>Herald</em> included news items written and published during school  terms by Tillamook high school students.</p>
