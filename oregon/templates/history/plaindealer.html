<p>The  <em>Plaindealer</em><br />
  [LCCN:  sn84022679]<br />
  Roseburg,  Douglas County,   Oregon <br />
  1870-1905</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <em>Roseburg</em> <em>Plaindealer </em>[LCCN: sn84022679] was founded as a Democratic political paper in March, 1870  by William Thompson. After coming to Oregon in 1852 from Polk County, Missouri,  he attended Columbia College in Eugene for a term, and with his experience at  two local newspapers – the <em>Eugene City  Review</em> [LCCN: sn2002060528]  and the <em>Eugene</em> <em>Guard</em> [LCCN: sn93051613] – he was prepared to start the <em>Plaindealer</em>.</p>
<p>The new  paper faced fierce competition from the <em>Roseburg</em> <em>Ensign</em> [LCCN: sn93051627] at first, and according to  Thompson, the <em>Plaindealer</em>&rsquo;s success &ldquo;&lsquo;was  not attained without gaining the enmity and bitter hatred of my would-be rivals  in business&rsquo;&rdquo; (quoted in Turnbull 1939, 234). Brothers Henry and Thomas Gale of  the <em>Ensign</em> had lost market share to  the <em>Plaindealer</em> and sought to regain  it &ldquo;by indulging in abuse of the coarsest character&rdquo; (Turnbull 1939, 234-235).  A shootout occurred one evening as Thompson and his friend, Virgil Conn, were  leaving the <em>Plaindealer</em> office.  Thomas Gale died of injuries from the fight, and Thompson, who was seriously &ldquo;wounded  in the neck . . . hit with a cane and shot several other times,&rdquo; sold the paper  to Lafayette F. Mosher and John W. Kelly on February 1, 1872 (Turnbull 1939, 235).  Henry Gale later became the editor for Canyon City&rsquo;s <em>The</em> <em>Grant  County Times</em> [LCCN: sn96088261]. </p>
<p>Rich  agricultural land and abundant forests had attracted early settlers to the  South Umpqua River valley as early as 1840, and the town of Deer Creek, later  to be named Roseburg, was established in 1851, quickly becoming the Douglas  County seat and a bustling commerce center. Roseburg acquired a new railroad  terminus – an important shipping point for annual wool and agricultural  products – shortly after the <em>Plaindealer</em> was established, and served as a strong impetus for the city&rsquo;s growth. As noted  in the April 25, 1873 edition, the railroad&rsquo;s &ldquo;advantages of location are  unsurpassed. It is not only the present terminus of the Oregon and California  Railroad, but it is the center of a large county trade. At this place in the  roads . . . all unite. In addition, the whole trade of the Southern part of the  county comes here.&rdquo; The county&rsquo;s population grew 58% in the decade following  the arrival of the railroad.</p>
<p>Under  publisher William H. Byars, the <em>Plaindealer</em> asserted Republican views and became a powerful political paper in the 1880s.  In 1879, the first daily edition of the paper was published and ran from  February to April before returning to weekly publication. Beginning on Monday,  August 5, 1895, the <em>Plaindealer</em> became – and stayed for the next decade – a semi-weekly paper. The <em>Plaindealer</em> picked up a set of ears  (i.e., text on either side of a newspaper&rsquo;s nameplate) for the rest of its  printing run, starting with its Monday, February 1, 1897 edition.  On the left of the name plate was written, &ldquo;If  you don&rsquo;t need the <em>Plaindealer</em>, you  don&rsquo;t get the news,&rdquo; and on the right, &ldquo;If you see it in the <em>Plaindealer</em>, it is so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  paper&rsquo;slast issue was released on  November 30, 1905. Under new ownership by a group of local Republicans, the  newspaper&rsquo;s name was changed to <em>Umpqua  Valley News</em> [LCCN: unknown]  in 1906. The mechanical director of the <em>News</em>, B.W. Bates, took sole control of the  paper in 1907 and started the <em>Roseburg  Evening News</em> [LCCN: 2003260223] in 1908 as the owner, editor, and publisher.</p>
