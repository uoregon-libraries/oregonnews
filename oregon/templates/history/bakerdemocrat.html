<p><em>Morning democrat<br />
</em>[LCCN: sn 85042398] <br />
  Baker City, Baker County, Oregon<br />
  1892 – 1929</p>
<p>As a social hub on the historic Oregon Trail, Baker City,  established in 1874, served as a support center for early gold mining in  Eastern Oregon. Inevitably, Baker City’s early newspapers featured coverage of  local mining events and opportunities. </p>
<p>The <em>Baker City Morning Democrat</em> [LCCN: sn85042398]  grew out of Baker’s City’s first newspaper, the <em>Bedrock Democrat</em> [LCCN: sn84022647], one of eastern Oregon’s oldest  papers. The <em>Bedrock Democrat</em> was  first published on May 11, 1870 by former Confederate army officer Lewis Linn  McArthur, and Oregon newspaper pioneer Milton H. Abbott. Abbott had previously founded  the <em>Portland Daily Oregon Herald</em> [LCCN:  sn85033164] and was partial owner of the <em>Albany  State Rights Democrat</em> [LCCN: sn84022644]. After two years at the <em>Bedrock Democrat</em>, MacArthur retired,  leaving Abbott as the sole proprietor.  Abbott worked with the <em>Oregon City Enterprise</em> [LCCN: sn94052321] in 1870, and later  founded the <em>Pendleton Eastern Oregon  Tribune</em> [LCCN: sn93051635] in 1873, followed by <em>The Dalles Oregon Weekly Tribune </em>[LCCN: sn84022685] in 1875. Abbott  became editor of the <em>La Grande Gazette </em>[LCCN:  sn93051649] in 1877 and edited <em>The Dalles  Oregon Democratic Journal</em> [LCCN: unknown] from  1884 to 1885.</p>
<p>In 1872, Jesse M. Shepherd bought the <em>Bedrock Democrat</em> and published the paper for eight years with his  son, Harry C. Shepherd. In 1873, R.B. Boyd &amp; Co. established the <em>Baker City</em> <em>Weekly</em> <em>Herald </em>[LCCN: sn93051609],  a Democratic competitor, but by 1875 the <em>Herald</em> became Republican and ceased publishing shortly after. In 1880, Shepherd sold  the <em>Democrat</em> to the Bedrock  Publishing Company, with Ira B. Bowen and J.T.  Donnelly as editors. During that time, Abbott, one of the <em>Democrat</em>’s original founders, began  working with another competitor, the <em>Baker  County Reveille </em>[LCCN: sn93051607], a Democratic paper that eventually  suspended in the late 1880s.</p>
<p>In 1887, Bowen &amp; Small, of which Donnelly was a part,  purchased the paper, changing the paper&rsquo;s title to the <em>Daily Morning Democrat </em>[LCCN:  sn96088185]. The name was changed to the <em>Morning  Democrat</em> [LCCN: sn85042398] in 1892 and continued to print every morning  except Monday. As of 1893 the paper had a steam Cottrell rotary press, and the  plant had 12 employees and was worth about $10,000. Covering local, state,  national and international news and politics, public opinions, and theatrical  events, the newspaper asserted: &ldquo;Everybody reads the <em>Democrat</em>.&rdquo; The 1890s brought weekly circulation to 2500, with a  daily circulation of 1200.</p>
<p>
  The <em>Morning Democrat</em> claimed to be &ldquo;always in the lead&rdquo; as &ldquo;the distributing point for the mining  districts of eastern Oregon.&rdquo; A special illustrated souvenir mining edition  published in 1900 reported on &ldquo;Eastern Oregon&rsquo;s gold fields – marvelous wealth  in mining, farming, lumbering…stock and fruit raising…&rdquo; Other issues from the  early 1900s included reports on legislation related to the treatment of Native  Americans, Japanese immigration, African American soldiers, and race issues in  the U.S. Senate, as well as mining strikes and union news. The <em>Democrat</em> sometimes published non-news  items such as the &ldquo;Indian Legend of the John Day River.&rdquo; Advertisements for  women&rsquo;s apparel were plentiful, but coverage of women&rsquo;s issues was generally  lacking, save for opinion columns such as one 1907 article titled &ldquo;Women Oppose  the Woman Suffrage Move.&rdquo; By 1906, the paper&rsquo;s motto became &ldquo;Baker City First,  Last, and all the Time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1919 Will H. Evans  took partial ownership of the <em>Democrat</em>,  and in 1929, Ernest L. Crockatt took over Bowen&rsquo;s interest. Ralph H. Mitchell, previous  editor of the <em>Portland Oregonian</em> [LCCN:  sn83025138], took over for Crockatt, and gained full ownership of the paper. In  1929, the <em>Democrat</em> merged with the <em>Evening Baker Herald </em>[LCCN: sn96088188],  forming the <em>Democrat-Herald </em>[LCCN: sn85000362],  an evening newspaper under the leadership of editor Bernard Mainwaring and  manager Lucien P. Arant. Evans remained as advertising manager. The paper was  published every evening except Sunday until 1990.</p>
