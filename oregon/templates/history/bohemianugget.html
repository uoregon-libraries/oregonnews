<p>The<em> Cottage Grove Bohemia nugget</em><br />
  [LCCN:  sn96088074] <br />
  Cottage  Grove, Lane County, Ore. <br /> 
  1899-1907
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Anglo settlers moved through the southern Willamette  Valley of central Oregon, the small settlement of Cottage Grove was established  and incorporated in 1887. By the 1890s, over 3,000 people lived in the city due  to the discovery of gold in nearby creeks which led to the Bohemia mining boom  (Center for Columbia River History).</p>
<p>In 1897, Horace Mann started the <em>Cottage Grove Messenger </em>[LCCN: unknown],  a weekly newspaper published on Fridays. However, in 1899, C.J. Howard bought the paper and changed its name to the <em>Cottage Grove</em> <em>Bohemia Nugget</em> [LCCN: sn96088074], publishing the first issue on  January 20, 1899. The <em>Nugget</em> started  as a politically Independent paper, but shifted to Republican views by 1900  under ownership of Bohemia mining promoter Frank J. Hard, manager of Cottage  Grove&rsquo;s first newspaper, <em>The</em> <em>Leader </em>[LCCN: sn96088077].</p>
<p>Direction of the <em>Nugget</em> changed frequently over the eight years of its existence. T.H. Supple of Portland contributed for a short time in 1901, and  Lee Henry joined Howard in 1902, taking over the paper for a short time before Howard  regained full control the same year. In 1903, Reverend Barton C.V. Brown became  associated with the paper as well. As of November 27, 1903, A. P. Bettersworth was listed as the  sole owner, although true ownership at the time belonged to C.J. Hurd, and Colonel Warner A. Root  quickly replaced Bettersworth.  J. McKean Fisher was editor in 1906,  and in 1907, Walter C. Conner and Joe DuBruille, publishers of the <em>Cottage Grove</em> <em>Leader</em> [LCCN: sn96088075], bought the <em>Nugget, </em>consolidating the two papers under the <em>Leader</em> title.  In 1918, the <em>Leader</em> was bought out by its rival  paper, the <em>Cottage Grove Sentinel</em> [LCCN: sn96088073].</p>
<p>According to Cottage Grove newspaper pioneer Elbert Bede,  the community&rsquo;s early papers, like the <em>Nugget</em>,  &ldquo;were strong for colonels and preachers&rdquo; (Turnbull 1939, 270). The <em>Nugget</em> was specifically directed toward  miners at first, featuring advertisements for mining supplies and mining news on  the front page.  The paper claimed to be  &ldquo;Devoted to the Mining, Lumber, and Farming Interests of this Community, to  Good Government, and Hustling for a Living,&rdquo; a motto that changed to &ldquo;…Hustling  for a Grub Stake&rdquo; in 1900, and then shortened to simply, &ldquo;Devoted to the  Mining, Lumber, and Farming Interests of this Community&rdquo; by 1905.</p>
<p>The <em>Nugget</em> also  featured short stories, local and social updates, statewide, national, and  international news of governmental actions and wars, and included similar columns  to other papers of the time with jokes, daily sermons, and agricultural  segments. Towards the end of its run, mining issues became less apparent in the <em>Nugget</em>, but even today the people of  Cottage Grove continue to celebrate the history of their town with the Bohemia  Mining Days Festival.</p>
