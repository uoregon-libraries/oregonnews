<p>The  <em>Springfield news </em><br />
  [LCCN:  sn97071001], [LCCN: sn97071003]<br />
  Springfield,  Lane County,    Oregon <br />
  1903-1914,  1916-present</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 1848, the first Anglo settlers arrived in what is now the  City of Springfield, located along the Willamette River in central Oregon, and  the city was incorporated in 1885. Farming, logging, and flour and saw mills  provided sustenance for early settlers, and in 1891, a railroad line was built  through the city, expanding the economic and transportation opportunities of  the area.</p>
<p>In 1896, John Kelly founded the <em>Springfield Nonpareil</em> [LCCN: unknown]  during a lull in local newspaper journalism, and in 1898 Kelly sold the paper to J.F. Woods, who changed the title to <em>The Springfield News</em> [LCCN: sn97071001] in  1903. In 1909, Woods sold the <em>News</em> to  Lewis M. Beebe, who continued to publish the paper for the next five years. The <em>News</em> was consolidated with the <em>Lane County News</em> [LCCN: sn97071002], a  prohibition paper, in 1914, and the Lane County Publishing Association took  over the paper under the editorship of University of Oregon graduate and former  Eugene newspaperman William A. Dill. The <em>Lane  County</em> <em>News</em> was issued twice  weekly on Mondays and Thursdays for just $1.50 per year. Dill later went on to  work for the <em>Portland Morning</em> <em>Oregonian </em>[LCCN: sn83025138]. </p>
<p>The News followed standard journalism of the time, providing  condensed news reports for busy readers, updates on tax laws, international  relations, legal and land notices, Oregon state news, and social updates for  the people of Springfield. Short stories, political cartoons and jokes could be  found amongst reports on lumbering, fruit and farming industries, new roads and  railroads, irrigation projects, and the Springfield flour mill. Local  advertisers included the Springfield Garage, the Bell Theater, the First  National Bank of Springfield, the Springfield Feed Company, and the J.W.  Hubbard Shoe Shop for loggers and millmen.</p>
<p>In 1916, Walter R. Dimm, a graduate from the University of  Oregon&rsquo;s School of Journalism, began publishing under <em>The Springfield News</em> [LCCN: sn97071003] title once again with help  from his father, printer Jon C. Dimm. From 1919 to 1924, the <em>News</em> was published once a week on Fridays  and publishers included Tage &amp;  Cagley, Lynn W. Miller, Robert A. Brodie, S.H. Tyler and S.M. Freeland,  followed by Freeland and T.V. Henderson.  The August 29, 1919 issue of the <em>News</em> contained a message from Tage and Cagley, in response to threats and  criticism from an un-named local &ldquo;element,&rdquo; explaining that</p>
<p>&ldquo;So long as the <em>News</em> is under the present ownership, we  will print all the news that is fit to print, and we will criticize the public  actions and utterances of anyone who we believe deserves it, without fear or  favor, regardless of whatever &lsquo;side&rsquo; he or she belongs to…What we want in Springfield  and what the <em>News</em> will endeavor to  cultivate in the minds of ALL her citizens is teamwork. Teamwork is to a town  what good health is to an individual…Let us lay the foundation of a new, a  greater, a better Springfield – better for ourselves to live in and better for  those who will follow us.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Two issues later, the paper came under new ownership,  advocating for Republican politics and vowing &ldquo;to boost for every public and  private enterprise or undertaking which tends toward advancement of Springfield  and surrounding country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1924, H. Elmer Maxey, reporter for the <em>Eugene Daily Guard</em> [LCCN: sn96088107],  took over and continued to publish the <em>News</em> into the 1930s. Maxey enlarged the paper from five to six columns and lowered  the subscription price from $2.00 to $1.25. Under Maxey&rsquo;s leadership the <em>News</em> promoted the Willamette Valley  irrigation and navigation project, of which Maxey was the president. </p>
