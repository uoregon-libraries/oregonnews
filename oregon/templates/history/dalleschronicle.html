<p>The  <em>Dalles Daily Chronicle</em><br />
  [LCCN:  sn85042448] <br />
  The  Dalles, Wasco County, Oregon <br />
  1890  – 1948</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Founded in north-central Oregon along the Columbia River,  The Dalles was historically known to mark the end of the Oregon Trail, and its  geographical location made it a prime center for trade, commerce, and shipping.</p>
<p>In response to a partisan battle for control of municipal  water rights, and in direct opposition to the stance of competing newspaper <em>The Dalles Times-Mountaineer</em> [LCCN: unknown], <em>The  Dalles Daily Chronicle</em> [LCCN: sn85042448] was founded by a group of  stockholders and incorporators on December 10, 1890 as an evening daily,  although the <em>Chronicle</em> was released  in the morning for a few weeks in 1908. John H. Cradlebaugh was the first  editor, followed by Hugh Gourlay in 1891 when Cradlebaugh became editor of the <em>Hood River Glacier</em> [LCCN: sn97071110]. DeWitt  Clinton Ireland, formerly of Portland, Oregon City, and Astoria, was editor for  a time, and went on to edit the <em>Wasco County  Sun </em>[LCCN: sn93051664] from 1893 to 1894. Editors at the turn of the  century included Samuel L. Brooks, Frederick Wallace Wilson, Richard J. Gorman,  Miss Rose Mitchell, and John Mitchell, with Cradlebaugh and Rose Mitchell  serving more than once.</p>
<p>Early issues featured international news and events under  major headlines on the front page, followed by interesting or alarming tidbits  of national, statewide, and local news, as well as &ldquo;How To&rdquo; columns and advice.  The <em>Chronicle</em> reported briefly on the practices of other cultures, such as comments on the  &ldquo;curious Indian custom&rdquo; of the potlatch, &ldquo;a thing so foreign to us…that we have  no word or phrase to give its meaning,&rdquo; and the curiosity of Japanese doctors who  charge no fee for their services.  Conflicting  opinions on diversity abound in early issues, with use of the term &ldquo;red men&rdquo;  followed by support for Native American citizenship and voting rights on the  Umatilla reservation, disapproval of Chinese immigration to the United States through  Canada, surprise at &ldquo;A Negro Servant&rsquo;s Wit,&rdquo; and expressed wishes for Japanese  immigrants to be excluded from the United States. </p>
<p>The <em>Chronicle</em> offered a pointedly Republican stance on political issues, regularly responding  to political opinions and claims expressed by other regional newspapers and  asserting that &ldquo;There is no reason why every man on the Republican ticket of  Wasco County, from congressman to constable, should not be elected.&rdquo; After  backing the Republican Party during campaigns for a local election in 1900, the  paper claimed, &ldquo;The <em>Chronicle</em> has  nothing but kind words personally for the Democratic candidates,&rdquo; but a few  issues later stated: &ldquo;The Democratic party is between the Devil and the deep  sea.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Publishers in the 1900s included H.G. Miller, Harold T. Hopkins, Clarence Hedges, W.P. Merry, and Ben R. Liftin, the <em>Chronicle</em>&rsquo;s most prominent editor.  Liftin had arrived in The Dalles three days before Christmas in 1906 with only  20 cents in his pocket. He came to work for the <em>Chronicle</em> under H.G. Miller,  and found the plant to be a mess. Liftin cleaned up the shop and became  co-manager in 1908, then bought the paper with Miller in 1909. In 1915, the <em>Chronicle</em> was sold to Clarence Hedges,  but Liftin remained as manager.</p>
<p>In 1920, Liftin shared ownership with real estate operator  and fruit-rancher W.P. Merry, and in  1923 Liftin became the sole proprietor. Liftin was steadfast to print the news  in the face of threatened boycotts and attempts to stifle his press. He retired  from the <em>Chronicle</em> in 1947 and served  as president of The Dalles Chamber of Commerce and director of the Oregon State  Editorial Association.</p>
