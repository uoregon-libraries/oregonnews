<p>The  <em>Oregon scout </em><br />
  [LCCN:  sn93051670] <br />
  Union,  Union County, Oregon <br />
  1884-1918</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The town of Union, nestled in the fertile Grand Ronde River  valley of Northeastern Oregon, was platted in 1864 along the Oregon Trail, named  in reference to the Union side of the Civil War. As an important freight  transfer station for mining districts near the Columbia River and Eastern  Oregon, early settlers engaged in the freighting business, and railroads  eventually encompassed the region. Over time, lumber and saw mills, wheat  mills, and agricultural endeavors contributed to the local economy. </p>
<p>The <em>Union Oregon Scout </em>[LCCN: sn93051670], a Democratic newspaper founded in July of 1884 by  photographer and editor Amos K. Jones, photographer Charles M. Jones, and  printer Emery Clingham, began as &ldquo;a semi-weekly paper devoted to news,  literature, and humor,&rdquo; published every Tuesday and Friday morning by the Union  Publishing Company at $2.00 per  year&rsquo;s subscription.  Originally, the <em>Scout</em> was a  four-column folio printed one page at a time on a quarter medium job press, and  was later enlarged to a six-column paper with eight pages, printed on a  hand-power cylinder press.</p>
<p>In the early years of publication, issues featured local  news and events, statewide news, and regional reports from other press sources,  and soon incorporated international news stories as well. Although little is  mentioned about race and ethnicity in the region, the <em>Scout</em> did report on the smuggling of Chinese workers across the  Canadian border, and the &ldquo;impudence&rdquo; of Chinese highbinders. On April 20, 1888,  the <em>Scout</em> reprinted news of the 1887  Snake River Massacre, recounting the brutal murder of several Chinese gold  miners that was never brought to justice. The <em>Scout</em> also reported on civil rights issues, bringing attention to  the unjust treatment of women in China.</p>
<p>Publications in the later years of the 19th  century included agricultural columns &ldquo;devoted to the interests of farmers and  stockmen,&rdquo; as well as &ldquo;Women and the Home&rdquo; articles on how to care for children  and other domestic responsibilities. Education of children was a primary  concern among the men and women of Union, as reflected in the <em>Scout</em>&rsquo;s columns on the &ldquo;Rights of  Children,&rdquo; and advocacy for women&rsquo;s rights is apparent in &ldquo;Woman&rsquo;s World&rdquo;  sections featuring new fields for women&rsquo;s work, such as piano tuning,  horticulture, and sanitary engineering, as well as college education  opportunities for women. </p>
<p>As the paper matured, it truly lived up to its self  proclaimed description as being &ldquo;Newsy, Spicy, Bright.&rdquo; The <em>Scout</em> featured jokes, amusing scenarios  and dialogue exchanges, short stories with illustrations, poetry, comics, plays  on words and witty sayings, editorials, &ldquo;Queer Stories&rdquo; from around the world,  and fiction such as &ldquo;Finding the Pole&rdquo; by Jules Verne.  At the same time, the <em>Scout </em>offered updates on politics, often covering local Democratic  Conventions as well as national political debates and presidential candidates.  In its last several years of publication, the <em>Scout</em> included friendly reports on local Native Americans on the  Umatilla Indian Reservation, news of new railroads, and the excitement of city  and community building.</p>
<p>Ownership of the <em>Scout</em> passed to B. Chancey on March 5,  1891, but founder Amos K. Jones soon took over again until 1899. William H.  McComas published the <em>Scout</em> until  1901, at which time W.A. Maxwell purchased the paper and continued publishing until his son, Floyd W. Maxwell,  took charge in 1916 with contributions from Christ Christensen, Lowell &amp; Sheets, Rodney J. Kitchen,  and B.F. Wilson. On February 11,  1918, Floyd Maxwell left Union to serve in World War I, and the <em>Scout</em> plant was sold to the <em>Eastern Oregon Republican</em> [LCCN: sn00063534],  the <em>Scout</em>&rsquo;s local competitor. Upon  his return from the service, Maxwell became editor of the University of  Oregon&rsquo;s student newspaper, the <em>Eugene</em> <em>Oregon Emerald </em>[LCCN: 2004260238],  and later became motion-picture editor of the <em>Portland</em> <em>Oregonian </em>[LCCN:  sn83025138].</p>
