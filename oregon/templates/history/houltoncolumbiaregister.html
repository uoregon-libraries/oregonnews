<p><em>The Columbia Register</em><br />
[LCCN: sn97071109]<br />
Houlton, Columbia County, Or.<br />
1904-1906</p>
<p>The &ldquo;story of Oregon journalism&rdquo;  is dynamic; low initial cost, a need for news in undeveloped areas, and ample  resources meant demand for publications was high, and papers could be readily  supplied.  Newspapers would spring up,  seemingly overnight, to fill a singular need.   Some were created to promote political causes, to encourage settlement  during pioneer days, or to simply provide news for a burgeoning town.  Others were meant to bring literature and art  to the masses and to provide a platform for fledgling Oregon writers and  artists.  Changing political ideologies, lack  of patronage, consolidations and even towns being left off railway lines could  contribute to the demise of a newspaper.   The <em>Columbia Register </em>[LCCN:  sn97071109], a short-lived, political publication established by Robert H.  Mitchell, typifies the Oregon newspaper experience through its origin,  evolution and abrupt end.<br />
  <br />
  Robert H. Mitchell was born in  1854 in Marshall County, Illinois and spent his formative years in the central  part of the state.  He received a public  education and apprenticed for several years as an iron moulder, eventually turning  his attention to the printing press.  He  began moving westward, like the pioneers before him, and ran county newspapers  in Kansas until 1879.  In an allegedly  dramatic and unfortunate twist of fate, &ldquo;a cyclone swept away the <em>Dighton</em> <em>Eagle</em>&rdquo;[LCCN: unknown]  abruptly ending his career with that newspaper.   Mitchell, unfazed, established the <em>Dighton  Progress </em>[LCCN: sn85030095] the following year and then continued on as a  newspaperman in Nebraska.  He eventually moved  to Cornelius, Oregon in 1888 where he would edit the <em>Hillsboro</em> <em>Independent </em>[LCCN:  sn93051621].  In 1894 Mitchell, along  with C. W. Clow, founded the <em>Hillsboro</em> <em>Argus </em>[LCCN: sn96088160] but sold the  paper that same fall.  He moved to Vernonia  where he then ran the <em>Nehalem</em> <em>Journal</em> [LCCN: unknown], the town&rsquo;s  first paper, as a Democratic weekly.  In  1898 he became editor of the <em>Columbia  County News </em>[LCCN: 2011260114]<em>.</em>  Newspapers were prolific and, like many  editors, Mitchell would bounce from publication to publication.  Consequently, he became a savvy and experienced  editor and writer by the time he established the <em>Columbia Register</em>.</p>
<p>Around the turn of the century, Mitchell  purchased the <em>Rainier Gazette </em>[LCCN:  sn00063655] from C. W. Herman for $350. Mitchell took this opportunity to  assure his readers in the December 17, 1901 issue of the <em>Gazette </em>that he assumed new responsibilities with the acquisition  but was &ldquo;assured of hearty support [since] the <em>Gazette</em> will be better prepared to give the news of the county&rdquo;  than under previous proprietors.  Like most  newspapermen of the day, Mitchell oftentimes used his publications for personal  promotion.  Mitchell continued to print the <em>Gazette </em>in Rainier, but a few years  later he moved the printing plant to the nearby &ldquo;little town of Houlton,&rdquo; where  he established the <em>Columbia Register. </em></p>
<p>Debuting on April 29, 1904, the eight-page,  six-column publication was printed every Friday, and a year subscription cost  readers $1.00.  Mitchell writes in the  first issue that he believed there to be a need for a paper &ldquo;in opposition to  the three Republican Party papers.&rdquo;  It  was the paper&rsquo;s policy to &ldquo;favor good government, as opposed to Republican  misrule,&rdquo; meaning the <em>Register </em>would  have strong Democratic leanings.   Mitchell would go on to make the bold claim that the <em>Columbia Register</em> would &ldquo;always be the  best paper in the county.&rdquo;   Unfortunately, this was not the case, as the paper was suspended in just  two years.</p>
<p>The <em>Register</em> reported on local and state news but devoted substantial  space to Democratic Party issues and news from the nation&rsquo;s capital.  International news was also covered  regularly.  A column entitled &ldquo;News of  the Week&rdquo; featured condensed, typically one-sentence news items to quickly  cover important news stories, reminiscent of today&rsquo;s &ldquo;Tweets.&rdquo;  Serial stories were also published, with a  chapter or two appearing in each issue of the <em>Register</em>.  &ldquo;The Planter&rsquo;s  Daughter or Fate&rsquo;s Revenge&rdquo; by Mrs. Alice P. Carriston, &ldquo;Master of the Mine&rdquo; by  Robert Buchanan and &ldquo;The Red Storm&rdquo; by Joel Robinson were just a few of the serials  to appear.</p>
<p>Printing a newspaper was a  labor-intensive job, and certain presses could make or break a publication.  The <em>Register </em>had been using a second-hand Washington press that was brought in from &ldquo;its  hiding place in the woods&rdquo; for almost a year.   In February of 1905, Mitchell purchased a Prouty press, sometimes called  a &ldquo;Kansas Grasshopper&rdquo; due to the two long bars which swung back and forth  resembling the legs of its namesake.   This was a marked improvement over the earlier press.  The <em>Register </em>proudly printed a picture of the new Prouty and declared that &ldquo;in one hour  after going to press, we can have our entire edition of six hundred copies all  printed and ready for the mailing clerk.&rdquo;   Whenever a new press was purchased, it was not unusual for a newspaper to  boast about the modernization and invite the public to see the new machine in  action.</p>
<p>In April of 1905, the <em>Register&rsquo;s</em> new press began printing the <em>Rainier Gazette</em>, which Mitchell still owned  and edited.  Mitchell stated, in a jab at  the Republican-leaning <em>Oregon Mist </em>[LCCN:  2004260421], &ldquo;The <em>Gazette </em>is out-stripping  the <em>Mist</em> in the lower end of the  county, and the <em>Register</em> is doing the  same for him in the upper end of the county.&rdquo;   These politically fueled insults were very common and newspapers were often  used as vessels for personal and political vendettas.  By July of that same year, Mitchell suspended  the <em>Rainier Gazette</em>,and all subscribers were &ldquo;supplied with  the <em>Columbia Register</em> in lieu of the <em>Gazette.</em>&rdquo;  </p>
<p>On June 1, 1906, Harry G. Kemp became  editor of the <em>Register </em>and the paper  moved to Rainier, Oregon.  Like many Oregon  newspapers before it, the <em>Columbia  Register</em> lasted for only a short while longer and then dissolved into  obscurity. It&rsquo;s difficult to know what became of the <em>Register</em> after June 1. The 1907 <em>N.W  Ayer &amp; Son&rsquo;s American Newspaper Annual</em> lists the <em>Columbia Register</em> existing in Rainier, edited by Kemp, but it also  lists the title in Houlton, edited by Mitchell.   Neither entry appeared in 1908, and Mitchell was living in Washington  state by 1910. </p>
