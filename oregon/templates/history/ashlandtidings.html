  <p>Many ambitious settlers were drawn to the southern Oregon  town of Ashland, incorporated in 1874, including <em>Oregon Sentinel</em> [LCCN: sn84022657] editor James M. Sutton, founder of  the town&rsquo;s first newspaper, the <em>Ashland  Tidings</em>. First published on June 17, 1876, the <em>Tidings</em> began as a weekly issued on Saturdays, consisting of a four-page  spread with six columns per page, at $2.00 for a year&rsquo;s subscription. </p>
    <p>The <em>Tidings</em> changed hands numerous times before experiencing relative stability in  management around 1879. Within months of launching the paper, Sutton sold the <em>Tidings</em> to Ashland businessman John M.  McCall. Beginning in 1878, Oliver C. Applegate managed the paper for a short  time. Corliss Merritt and William Leeds together bought the paper in 1879,  though Merritt soon sold out to Leeds. Leeds operated the <em>Tidings</em> until 1894 when he sold his interests to longtime employee  Fred D. Wagner, who served as editor and publisher until 1911. After Wagner,  Connecticut editor Ralph B. Bennett and his brother, Leigh Bennett, conducted  the paper for one year before selling. </p>
   <p>The <em>Tidings&rsquo;</em> format and coverage evolved significantly throughout its initial period of  publication. In early versions, the paper was limited to four pages of local  news, editorials, advertising, and folk tales. Leeds added features such as  national news stories on the front page and a &ldquo;Local Brevities&rdquo; section  consisting of short updates on activities of local figures and organizations. Originally  &ldquo;independent in all subjects,&rdquo; the <em>Tidings</em> began to overtly favor the Republican agenda in the 1880s. Editorials supported  women&rsquo;s suffrage and local miners&rsquo; strikes.  By 1896, the <em>Tidings</em> was issued semi-weekly, distributed on Mondays and Thursdays,  and an entire page was devoted to women&rsquo;s issues and news, likely stemming from  its pro-suffragist stance. The paper also highlighted labor unions&rsquo; support of the  railroad industry&rsquo;s potential for creating local jobs. Early coverage of race  and ethnicity shifted from overtly critical treatments of Native Americans and  Chinese immigrants to presenting non-whites as oddities, as demonstrated by an  1889 headline: &ldquo;Japanese Wedding; Have you witnessed yet?&rdquo; </p>
    <p>The <em>Tidings</em> underwent significant changes under the management of veteran editor and publisher  Bert R. Greer from 1912 to 1927. In 1919, Greer, the successful former editor  of the <em>Kansas City Tribune </em>[LCCN:  sn85032310], changed the paper&rsquo;s title to the <em>Ashland Weekly Tidings</em> and expanded with a daily publication, the <em>Ashland Daily Tidings. </em>Greer also  increased the page count to eight and added a local society section titled &ldquo;In  the Social Realm.&rdquo; By 1922, Greer began highlighting the paper&rsquo;s status as an  &ldquo;International News Wire Service.&rdquo; In 1928, the Ashland Printing Company  assumed management of the <em>Tidings</em>.  After a title change to <em>The Daily Tidings</em> [LCCN: sn96088008] in 1970 and then back to the <em>Ashland Daily Tidings</em> [LCCN: sn96088007]  in 1993, current publication now runs  six days a week, Monday through Saturday, and  maintains a circulation of 5,500 among the communities of Ashland, Talent, Phoenix and Medford.
