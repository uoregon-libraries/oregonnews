<p>Created in May of 1883 by Isaac  LeMahieu, the <em>Oregon City Courier</em> [LCCN:  sn00063694] was a leading publication in the Willamette Valley, merging with  several newspapers throughout its span.  Even  though the paper changed hands, names, and political leanings several times  during its 67 years in print, the <em>Courier</em> alwaysreflected the needs and wants  of Clackamas County.</p>
<p>Isaac LeMahieu was born in  Holland in 1841 and immigrated to the United States early in life.  Eventually settling in Oregon in 1882,  LeMahieu recognized the lack of Democratic news sources in the dominantly Republican  county, and he created the <em>Oregon City  Courier</em> to fill that void.  The paper  began as a four-page weekly publication, costing $2.00 a year.  The front and second pages were devoted to  international and general interest news, with special attention paid to  national events.  Page three covered local  news and advertising, with the last page typically featuring short stories,  poetry and agricultural and market reports.   The paper took a strong interest in politics and reported on local,  state and national elections.</p>
<p>At some point in the late 1880s,  LeMahieu dropped &ldquo;City&rdquo; from the title and the paper was published as the <em>Oregon Courier</em> [LCCN: sn00063695].  The publication continued its Democratic  tendencies and remained relatively unchanged; articles criticizing Republican  candidates were still normal fodder.   News from the nation&rsquo;s capital continued to be covered, and advertising now  appeared on all pages.</p>
<p>On September 8, 1894, due to  declining health, LeMahieu sold the <em>Oregon  Courier</em> to A. W. Cheney for $2,000.   Cheney, a native of Wisconsin whose own father was a newspaperman,  continued the paper&rsquo;s Democratic vision.   On September 13, 1895, the paper increased to eight pages in order to  accommodate the &ldquo;increased advertising patronage and to give its constantly  increasing list of subscribers more reading matter.&rdquo;  The new <em>Courier</em> was true to its word, with advertising dominating nearly every page including  the front.  At this point, a regular and  quite progressive column, &ldquo;Woman&rsquo;s World&rdquo; or &ldquo;Woman at Home,&rdquo; appeared and  reported on civil rights struggles, women in the workforce, and female activists  like Florence Nightingale, as well as covering topics like fashion and health  tips.</p>
<p>On July 10, 1896 Cheney changed  the name of the paper back to the <em>Oregon  City Courier</em> [LCCN: sn00063696].  Cheney  would prove to be an exceedingly competent proprietor and publisher; in 1898, he  purchased the <em>Oregon City</em> <em>Herald</em> [LCCN: unknown] and consolidated  it with the <em>Oregon City Courier</em>.  The new publication appeared on September 23,  1898 and ran as the <em>Oregon City Courier=Herald </em>[LCCN: sn00063697].  Since the two  papers shared a similar makeup, the political complexion remained Democratic.  In the first issue, Cheney and Charles A.  Fitch of the <em>Herald</em> stated that the  consolidation would make the paper&rsquo;s subscription list &ldquo;more than double in  size that of any other paper published in Clackamas County,&rdquo; and by 1900 the  paper&rsquo;s circulation was over 1,600.  The <em>Courier=Herald </em>would also be the  county&rsquo;s official paper with exclusive patronage of the sheriff&rsquo;s office.  </p>
<p>The paper continually and harshly  criticized the affairs of Republican President William McKinley and gave little  attention to his assassination.  After  McKinley was fatally shot on September 6, 1901, most papers contributed several  pages and issues to the passing of the President of the United States.  The <em>Courier=Herald </em>devoted only a single column to the death of the McKinley.  It was, in fact, found on page six, crammed  between advertisements for Castoria Digestive Syrup and fur coats.<u></u></p>
<p>On October 31, 1902, the  editorship of the <em>Courier=Herald</em> passed to John H. Westover, a Democratic newspaper publisher from Kentucky who  promised, under his new ownership, to &ldquo;dip [the] pen in the milk of human  kindness.&rdquo;  Westover dropped &ldquo;Herald&rdquo;  from the name and on November 7, 1902 the paper was once again published as the <em>Oregon City Courier</em> [LCCN:  sn00063698].  The <em>Courier</em> continued to be published weekly as an eight-page,  six-column folio. In 1905 a regular magazine section, typically four pages of  general news items, was included with the paper.  The magazine section was printed somewhat  sporadically the following year and reemerged on May 3, 1907 with an additional  comics page.  The &ldquo;funnies&rdquo; section  printed a variety of cartoons including the wildly popular &ldquo;Brownie Clown of  Brownietown&rdquo; by Palmer Cox and &ldquo;Herr Spiegleburger&rdquo; by Carl Anderson.  </p>
<p>From 1902 to 1919, the <em>Oregon City Courier</em> changed editors and  ownership frequently.  On April 15, 1904,  Shirley Buck and Professor Henry L. McCann replaced Westover as editor and proprietor.  Edward E. Brodie and A. E. Frost took over as  publishers in 1906, and by 1908 William A. Shewman Jr. was editor.  M. J. Brown, a newspaperman from New York, was  added to the editorial force of the <em>Courier </em>on April 14, 1911.  Despite the  Editor-in-Chief being indicted for criminal libel due to matters printed in the  June 27th, 1913 edition of the <em>Courier</em>,  circulation steadily increased and Brown remained editor and proprietor of the  newspaper until February 18, 1915 when E. R. Brown, unrelated, purchased the  paper, including &ldquo;the entire property, plant, building and…residence.&rdquo;  Cecil W. Robey would be the editor and  business manager the following year.  The <em>Courier</em> was popular with readers and  advertisers alike, and by the 1920s the paper was a &ldquo;most substantial, dependable,  profitable business.&rdquo;  </p>
<p>On July 8, 1919, the <em>Oregon City Courier</em> merged with the <em>Clackamas County Banner</em> [LCCN: sn00063693]  and began printing as the <em>Banner-Courier</em> [LCCN: sn00063699]; this is the paper&rsquo;s final iteration, with Fred J. Tooze and  Halbert E. Hoss at the helm.  After the  consolidation, the <em>Banner-Courier</em> had  a circulation each week of over 2,500, by far the most popular paper coming out  of Oregon City.  At this point in the  paper&rsquo;s existence, the <em>Banner-Courier</em> no longer focused on reporting national events with a Democratic slant and  instead turned attention to local news of the county and surrounding  areas.  Town meetings, local events, and  a page dedicated to &ldquo;Agricultural and Livestock News&rdquo; replaced the Republican-bashing  editorials that were so common before.   This change in substance could also be seen in the years leading up to  the merger with an increase in &ldquo;community-centered&rdquo; articles.  In 1909, for example, the <em>Courier </em>created an initiative to name  local homesteads which would then be listed on the &ldquo;Courier Registered List of  Farms.&rdquo;<br />

  On August 5, 1924, Edward A.  Koen, an experienced newspaperman from Minnesota, purchased the <em>Banner-Courier</em>.  E. A. Koen, along with his son Edward P. Koen,  would edit and publish the paper for the next twenty-six years.  </p>
<p>The <em>Banner-Courier</em> was printing twice a week by 1924, and due to this  increase, the paper was scaled back to four pages.  At this time, the <em>Banner-Courier </em>was also the &ldquo;only newspaper in the county carrying  a comic section.&rdquo;  The publication  continued to focus on the events and affairs of Clackamas County, like the  paving of roads and local elections, and proudly declared on every front page  that the <em>Banner-Courier</em> was &ldquo;printed  on newsprint manufactured in Oregon City.&rdquo;   However, in the 1930s and &lsquo;40s, when the world was engaged in the World  War II, international news dominated the publication.  The <em>Banner-Courier </em>reported heavily on the war efforts at home and abroad, printing material  on &ldquo;rubber drives&rdquo; and pictures of ravaged battlefields alike.  Despite the heavy coverage of war, the paper  was still a &ldquo;neighborly newspaper for all Clackamas county&rdquo; complete with a  local sports page and a regular column, &ldquo;Clackamas County Women,&rdquo; which  highlighted the achievements of resident women.   The <em>Banner-Courier </em>also  devoted significant space to &ldquo;radio programs&rdquo; by printing the schedules of many  stations. </p>
<p>The <em>Banner-Courier</em>, which was printed three times a week by 1950,  continued to be a popular and successful newspaper up until March 1, 1950 when E.  P. Koen bought the &ldquo;physical assets, good will, name and circulation&rdquo; of the <em>Oregon City Enterprise </em>[LCCN:  sn00063702] and merged the two papers.   The <em>Enterprise-Courier </em>[LCCN:  sn00063703], much like its predecessor, enjoyed a long and popular presence in  the community and was published until the 1990s.</p>
