 <p><em>St. Helens Mist</em><br/>
  [LCCN: sn2004260419]<br />
St.  Helen&rsquo;s, Columbia County, Or.<br />
1913  - 1933</p>
 <p>Preceded  only by the <em>Columbian </em>[LCCN: sn93051654], which survived from 1880 to 1886,  the <em>St. Helens Mist</em> is the oldest  newspaper in existence in Columbia County, where it is currently published as the <em>Chronicle </em>[LCCN: 2009260069].  Appearing in 1881 as the <em>Oregon Mist </em>[LCCN: 2004260421], the paper began as a result of a  vendetta between <em>Mist </em>publisher  William Glendye and Enoch Adams of the <em>Columbian</em>.  Regardless of Glendye&rsquo;s original motives, he  sold the paper within two years to Emmanuel H. Flagg, who then passed it to  Charles Meserve in 1890. Over the next five decades, the <em>Mist </em>was handled by a number of editors, presidents, and managers.</p>
 <p>Published  in St. Helens, Oregon, the seat of Columbia County and named after Mount St.  Helens, the<em> Mist </em>provided thorough coverage  of local affairs.  The paper reported on the  only legal hanging in Columbia County&rsquo;s history.  In 1901, August Schieve was implicated in the  murder of Joseph Schulkowski, a Polish immigrant who was found dead on the day  after Christmas.  Schieve was soon  convicted and sentenced to death.  The <em>Mist</em> reported afterward, &ldquo;Columbia  county has had its first execution for murder, and its citizens hope it will be  the last.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>By  1913, Flagg resumed ownership, changing the paper&rsquo;s name to <em>St. Helens Mist</em>.  Over the next ten years the paper would have  at least ten different owners, a few working on the weekly simultaneously as  partners.  In 1915, Steele L. Moorhead  bought the publication and introduced himself as a &quot;stayer&quot; who would  &ldquo;become a permanent fixture.&rdquo;  He sold  his interests to Simpson C. Morton in 1917.   Morton remained with the <em>Mist</em> for almost a decade, interrupting the steady march of newspapermen and newspaperwomen  who were associated with the publication over the course of its history.  During that time, he became the first  president of the Oregon Newspaper Conference.    By 1926, Morton decided to sell to George D. Borden and Ira B. Hyde but  remained on staff as an employee.</p>
 <p>Most  news content in the <em>Mist</em> was local,  covering items such as road construction, shipbuilding, shipping, and county  politics.  A 1916 issue reported a  longshoremen strike which threatened to close ports from Alaska to San  Diego.  Less parochial content is  exemplified by articles on World War I and President Wilson&rsquo;s support for a  League of Nations, which was ultimately rejected by the United States to the <em>Mist&rsquo;</em>s approval. Examples of  advertisements include St. Helens Hotel, Central Market, Columbia County Bank,  and St. Helens Mill Company.  Ads for  women&rsquo;s clothing, including a monkey fur coat worn by actress Estelle Clark,  draw from the popular image of the flapper, a younger, independent woman  associated with American culture in the 1920s. <br />

   In  1933 the <em>Mist</em> passed to Jessica  Longston and Berenice Anderson of the <em>St.  Helens Sentinel </em>[LCCN: 2004260420].   They merged the two papers, forming the <em>St. Helens</em> <em>Sentinel-Mist </em>[LCCN:  2004260418], announcing that the new arrangement satisfied a &ldquo;wish on the part  of business men of St. Helens&rdquo; to have only one paper representing the city&rsquo;s  interests.</p>
