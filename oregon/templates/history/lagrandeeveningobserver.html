<p><em>La Grande Evening Observer</em><br />
[LCCN: 2006260039]<br />
La Grande, Union County, Oregon<br />
1904-1959</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Founded in 1861, the city of La  Grande is nestled in the fertile Grande Ronde Valley of northeastern  Oregon.  Although located along the  Oregon Trail, La Grande expansion is owed to the arrival of the Oregon-Washington  Railroad and Navigation Company in 1884, which &ldquo;linked the milling and  gold-mining center to distant markets.&rdquo;   The railroad also spurred the development of journalism in the area, and  the &ldquo;newspaper history of La Grande revolves to a considerable extent around  the Currey family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>George Hoskins Currey, a native  of Vancouver, Washington, entered the newspaper business in 1896 when he moved  the press of the Baker City <em>Blade</em> [LCCN:  unknown] to La Grande.  That year he  launched the <em>Eastern Oregon Observer</em> [LCCN:  2006260032] as a &ldquo;Populist weekly opposed to the radical tendencies of the  People&rsquo;s Party movement.&rdquo;  Debuting on  October 20, 1896, it was the fifth paper in La Grande at the time.  However, the <em>Observer</em>, in one form or another, would outlive all of its  predecessors.  </p>
<p>The year following the paper&rsquo;s  debut, George&rsquo;s brother, Fred Currey, joined the editorial staff, and the Currey  Brothers published the <em>Daily Morning  Observer </em>[LCCN: 2006260037] from 1897 to 1898.  This led to a &ldquo;demand for a regular morning  daily paper,&rdquo; and the Curreys launched the <em>La  Grande Morning Observer</em> [LCCN: 2006260038] in 1901.  Finally, in 1904 the <em>Observer</em> switched to the evening timeslot and La Grande&rsquo;s <em>Evening Observer</em> [LCCN: 2006260039] was  born.</p>
<p>At this point, the Populist  Party was no longer a politically relevant platform and the <em>Observer </em>&ldquo;proclaimed its political  independence, but leaned toward progressive Republicanism.&rdquo;  The paper began as a six-page, six-column  sheet and was published every evening except Sundays.  Advertising dominated nearly every page with  a multitude of fonts and images, which might seem unfair considering that a  year&rsquo;s subscription cost readers a whopping $6.50.  Content was a hodgepodge of local news items  and classifieds, clipped miscellany from other papers, and brief national news  articles.  Early in the paper&rsquo;s lifetime,  the tone of the <em>Observer</em> was rather  moralistic, condemning alcohol and its consumers, for example.</p>
<p>In 1907, Fred Currey sold his  interest in the paper to his brother, George, and three years later, in 1910,  George sold the <em>Observer</em> to Bruce  Dennis.  Under Dennis, the papercontinued to grow, and the following  year, Dennis purchased the <em>Morning Star</em> [LCCN: 2006260042] and consolidated it with the <em>Observer.  </em>However, Dennis  would encounter problems, not with subscription rates or expenses, but with the  social and moral makeup of the town.</p>
<p>Racial tensions had historically  been high in the Grande Ronde Valley, which, ironically, was known as the &ldquo;Valley  of Peace&rdquo; by indigenous groups.  Men were  killed during ugly conflicts between white settlers and Native peoples, La  Grande&rsquo;s Chinatown was burned to the ground in 1893, and the Ku Klux Klan (KKK)  had a very active membership in the town.   George Huntington Currey, the son of George Hoskins Currey, spoke on the  Klan&rsquo;s presence in the area in 1969:  &quot;I  asked the quickest way to get out of [Baker City],&quot; he said, &quot;and I  was told, &lsquo;Just go out in the street, throw up your hat and yell, &lsquo;Down with  the Klan,&rsquo; and you'll find yourself out of town in a hurry.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The earliest iterations of the <em>Evening Observer</em>, under George Hoskins  Currey, encouraged the expulsion of Chinese residents.  However, under Bruce Dennis&rsquo; editorship, the <em>Evening Observer</em> took a very different  stance, and Dennis even became known as an adversary of the Klan. In his book, <em>Inside the Klavern: The Secret History of  the Ku Klux Klan of the 1920s</em>, David Horowitz writes, &ldquo;Republican state  senator, Bruce Dennis, the owner, publisher, and editor of the La Grande<em> Evening Observer</em> since 1910, was a  frequent Klan target.  Although local KKK  activities seldom received coverage in the <em>Observer</em>,  one of Dennis&rsquo;s editorials had attacked the influence of &lsquo;secret societies&rsquo; in  state politics.&rdquo;  Dennis condemned &ldquo;mob&rdquo;  rule and viewed the Klan and its &ldquo;members as breeders of trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Klan as a major presence,  however, was a flash in the pan, and by the time Dennis sold the <em>Observer</em> in 1925, La Grande&rsquo;s klavern  was a husk of its former self, and the paper&rsquo;s succeeding editors were not  troubled by the organization.  Frank B.  Appleby, a successful publisher from Iowa, and Harve Mathews were editors and  owners until June 19, 1930, when they sold the paper to P. R. Finlay.  Upon his death, Finlay&rsquo;s son, Harold, assumed  the editorship in 1932.  Finlay sold the <em>Observer </em>to Harvey Bowen in 1938.</p>
<p>The <em>Observer</em> continued to be a popular daily newspaper and was &ldquo;one of  the largest and most successful in Oregon outside of Portland.&rdquo;  The 1940s and &lsquo;50s saw the usual  changes:  bigger and better graphics,  space devoted to &ldquo;TV Listings,&rdquo; and the addition of a sports page.  Riley D. Allen was publisher when, on May 27,  1959, the name was changed to the <em>La  Grande Observer </em>[LCCN: 2006260040] since, technically, the <em>Observer</em> was not an evening newspaper;  &ldquo;it [was] an afternoon newspaper.&rdquo;</p>
