<p><em>The Oregon Argus</em><br />
[LCCN: sn83025129]<br />
Oregon City, Clackamas County, Oregon<br />
1855-1863 </p>
<p>The <em>Oregon Argus</em> [LCCN: sn83025129]  has the distinction of being the first Republican newspaper in Oregon, and  quite possibly the Pacific Coast, with its debut issue appearing on April 21,  1855.  </p>
<p>William Lysander Adams, the <em>Argus</em>&rsquo;  proprietor and first editor, had already made a name for himself in frontier  literature by the time the <em>Argus </em>was  first printed.  Having crossed the plains  in 1848, Adams became a farmer and teacher in Yamhill County.  A talented and well-educated man, Adams began  writing &ldquo;Whiggish attacks&rdquo; on the Democrats for the Portland <em>Oregonian </em>[LCCN: sn83045780] in 1851.  He frequently contributed political  commentary to this paper under the pseudonym &ldquo;Junius,&rdquo; and a year later he  penned Oregon&rsquo;s first satire, <em>A Melodrame Entitled &ldquo;Treason,  Stratagems, and Spoils&quot; </em>under the signature &ldquo;Breakspear,&rdquo; a play on Shakespeare&rsquo;s name. This  sharp and cultured attack on the members of the territory&rsquo;s Democratic Party is  considered the finest writing to come out of Oregon&rsquo;s frontier period.  The Melodrame, which was published serially  in the </em><em>Oregonian</em>,  also included the territory&rsquo;s first editorial cartoons, marking Adams as  Oregon&rsquo;s first published cartoonist as well.</em></p>
<p>It  is no shock that Adams&rsquo; paper, the <em>Oregon  Argus</em>, had distinctly pro-Whig, anti-Democratic undertones.  In 1855, Adams purchased the plant of the defunct <em>Oregon Spectator</em> [LCCN: sn84022662] for $1200 and began printing in Oregon City. The <em>Argus&rsquo; </em>motto, &ldquo;America…  knows nought of golden promises of Kings, Knows nought of Coronets, and Stars,  and Strings,&rdquo; only strengthened the paper&rsquo;s affiliation with the Whig Party and  its hostility towards sovereigns.  Before  his nomination for presidency, Abraham Lincoln even subscribed to the <em>Argus</em>.</p>
<p>The <em>Argus</em> was a six-column  folio, published every Saturday morning.   Subscriptions cost five dollars a year or three dollars for six months.  Such a pricy subscription rate can be  attributed to the paper&rsquo;s appearance so early on in the history of the state  when readers were few and far between.  The <em>Argus</em> covered Oregon City and  Clackamas County; its first issue declaring that it would &ldquo;penetrate many parts  of the country where Oregon papers are not taken.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The <em>Argus</em> reported on local  events, such as deaths and marriages, and especially focused on local  politics.  The paper took a very strong  pro-temperance stance with several columns devoted to the perceived follies of  liquor, but commentary was never religious in tone and, in fact, the <em>Argus</em> gave very little attention to  religious affairs.  International news appeared  sporadically as more space was dedicated to advertisements and coverage of the  Civil War dominated later issues.  The  paper also devoted &ldquo;a column or two to agricultural interests&rdquo; and encouraged  local farmers to write &ldquo;short, pithy communications&rdquo; on the topic.</p>
<p>One dispute that would lead to the demise of the Whig Party was the question  of whether or not territories should be admitted into the union as free or  slave states.  Since Oregon was granted  statehood in 1859, four years after the <em>Argus </em>first went to press, this issue was heavily covered in the paper.  The Whig Party may have been torn in half,  but the <em>Argus </em>took a decidedly pro-freedom  position and reported on anti-slavery meetings and events. </p>
<p>On April 16, 1859, after four years at the helm of the <em>Argus</em>, Adams turned control over to  David Watson Craig.  The paper continued  for the next four years relatively unchanged.   In May of 1863 the <em>Argus</em> was  moved to Salem, where it was consolidated with the <em>State Republican </em>[LCCN: sn83025130], another anti-slavery paper,  becoming a seven column publication with obvious political associations.  The <em>Oregon  Argus </em>was published every Monday by Craig and James Newton Gale until October  26, 1863, at which point the paper was combined with the <em>Oregon Statesman </em>[LCCN: sn85042470],which was purchased by Craig and others.  </p>
<p>In a letter from Craig to Adams, dated November 4, 1863, Craig comments  on the closing of the <em>Argus</em> and proclaims  that the <em>Oregon Statesman</em> will &ldquo;run  measurable on the right track&rdquo; but may not live up to the high standards set by  the <em>Argus</em>.</p>
